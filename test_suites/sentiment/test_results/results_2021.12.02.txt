4 (0.7) Mario Kart DS is a fun game for kids of all ages. Kids ages 6 and up will have the most success playing this game. There is a very large variety of race coarses, players, and karts. Some thing about this game can get frustrating, especially when you have to do Missions to unlock items and help win the game. The Missions (the last several) are tricky, despite the fact I am an experienced player. Overall the graphics are great and fun. I love this game.

1 (0.5) At first, this is a really fun game but my big problem with it is it's WAY TOO EASY.  Even on the hard settings, I had no problem. After you unlock everything, it gets very boring and I don't play it now.  It would be really good if it had a really hard level or more tracks to race on.  It was fun while it lasted but it's just not challenging enough.

4 (1.0) i bought the wireless controller because i was tried of wrapping and twisting the cables on the controller up, getting tangled up with other things, and never reaching where i wanted to sit.  the controller is versaltile and can be used as a wired remote when batteries are dead.

4 (0.7) I love playing this game. it has alot of different endings and its a great wifi game. The controls are a little different only because you use the touch screen to control your movement but youll get use to it after the first level or so. if you love star fox then this game wont disappoint.

3 (0.4) Halo 1 and Halo 2 are icons of the video game industry(rightfully so).But Halo 3 ( and all after it) just don't have the same playful and lighthearted feel of the first  two Halo games.Hardcore fans may enjoy it, otherwise steer clear and play Halo 1 or Halo 2 again.

2 (0.3) If it wasn't for the DRM I would give it high scores.  However, it is asking to much to have only 3 installs.  I would wait until EA gets it through their thick heads to remove the install limits before buying it.
