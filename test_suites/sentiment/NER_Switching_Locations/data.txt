Dynasty Warriors is one of my favorite franchises playing it all the way since Dynasty Warriors 4. The Empires spin-offs have always been better in my opinion, and this game is no exception.For the graphics, there is nothing special about them. The character models are decent for an early 360 game, but everything else is lacking. The draw distance is especially a problem since you can't see any soldiers that are only a few feet away from you.There are over 40 characters in this game, each with their own unique fighting style. You have all around characters such as Zhao Yun as well as overpowering bad asses such as Lu Bu. The voice acting for each character is better than past titles, but nothing noteworthy or special about it.As with all Dynasty Warriors titles, the heart of the game lies in its gameplay. Similar to other titles of the series, your goal is to hack and slash your way to victory, However, victory lies in connecting your main camp to your opponents. This can be done by taking over bases as well as defeating officers along the way. Even though this is seen as repetitive, it has allot of strategy since there are multiple routes you can take on the battlefield.The main mode is Empire mode, which has you picking a ruler and guiding your army to take over all of China. It is broken up into two phases. The strategic mode is where you enact various policies such as replenishing the troops in your army, forging alliances, creating tactics, etc. Having this really feels like you're in control and are able to forge your own destiny however you would like to. You also have to think about each choice you make as it costs resources (a.k.a. gold).Overall, this is a great experience. There is allot of strategy and depth when it comes to the Empire mode. As always, the best way to play this game is with a friend. It is even more fun when you are conquering China together as a team. My only complaints are the draw distance and the somewhat sluggish feel compared to the newer titles. However, I'd certainly recommend this to Dynasty Warriors fans as well as fans of tactical gameplay.

I was completely impressed with this game.  As an RPG series, Wild Arms has evolved very well.  And 4th Detonator is absolutely an improvement on past installments.But although Wild Arms 4 offers a great RPG experience, the best part of the game is the story line.  You simply can't get this kind of writing from contemporary Hollywood movies.Anyone who is looking for an alternative to mainstream media should check it out.

I have never played any previous MGS games. Really? the controls are hard ..? R1+L1= Zoom and Shoot. I will say it started off a bit slow but it picked up. A wide variety of weapons that you can customize, plenty of gear and plenty of ways to take out whom ever you please. The movies are long but there is a skip mode for those that are not interested. I'm in Iraq and have purchased all types of games and this is definitely a keeper. The story in itself is outstanding I was filled in on most of the saga. I don't let reviews dictate what i purchase just a good way to be inquisitive about what i will buy and this game in my eyes was great. I believe a must buy for the PS3....... cant wait for KILLZONE2, SF4, and yes GOD OF WAR 3. Hope this helps I have a 360, WII, Gaming PC and I must SAY i enjoy my BLUE RAY, HDVD, and Game Black MONSTER over all (PS3).May buy the White ONE!!!!

I have never played any previous MGS games. Really? the controls are hard ..? R1+L1= Zoom and Shoot. I will say it started off a bit slow but it picked up. A wide variety of weapons that you can customize, plenty of gear and plenty of ways to take out whom ever you please. The movies are long but there is a skip mode for those that are not interested. I'm in Nigeria and have purchased all types of games and this is definitely a keeper. The story in itself is outstanding I was filled in on most of the saga. I don't let reviews dictate what i purchase just a good way to be inquisitive about what i will buy and this game in my eyes was great.

I don't understand where EA went wrong. It was once the underdog and now is the overlord... After EA closed the Chicago site for a cheaper India/China location, I will be all too happy to see them go under. Why? Because the main reason for games is to relieve me of daily stress and not be the cause of it!Too bad I will miss out on a great game, and EA will miss out on some cash...DRM NOT!!!!

Be warned. This is not a Train sim, nor a tycoon game.This was made to compete with the RTS games. Problem isit even fails at that.It is very fast paced. Months roll by in seconds. Thetime periods do not match what's going on in the game.It can take 3 months game time for a train to go from LosAngeles to San Diego which happens in about 30 seconds (ifthat)It almost seems it was designed (like most PC games today)so that it could be easily played on a console. there arevery few options and granularity on controls.The AI stinks. The trains are too large for the land andlaying track is a nasty task. if your track drop doessomething funky you cant undo it.If you want some positives, well, It's somewhat playable.Bah scratch that.. It was a waste of money. I was going togive this 2 stars but I cant.  This game has failed injust about every aspect I can think of. If you are likethe rest of the growing population of adrenaline junkieswho desire fast paced thumb twitching mostly brainlessaction.. this game is for you.. Phooey

Others have commented more eloquently (and humorously) than me about the main aspects of the game, but I would like to comment on one issue that may disappoint some buyers the most. This game has almost zero replay value: once you've finished your 50-55 hour run, you'll find very little to compel you to play again, unless you found the story to be so captivating you need to experience it again. Without spoiling too much, beating the game unlocks a "Postgame" section that lets you explore certain areas again with your fully-developed characters, but you'll find that beyond finishing the optional monster-hunting missions, there is nothing to do.Also (and most importantly) you can't carry over your completed characters to repeat the story mode. If you want to replay the story, you have to start all over again. For the older Final Fantasy titles, this isn't too much of an issue, but for FF13, frankly, it just wasn't good enough to warrant doing all that work over. Shallow battle mechanics and a lack of depth, lack of exploration, and a lack of activities permeate the whole game. New fans may not be dissuaded, but series veterans will be heavily disappointed. Not to say the game is terrible, but the price you pay for excellent graphics, voice-acting, and production value is a serious slice into the "fun" factor. "Mediocre" is a better description of the gameplay itself. (It's obvious where nearly 5 years and millions of dollars went: Hollywood blockbuster presentation and graphics).For the cost-concious gamer, I think a rental is more appropriate. I may replay this game if I get bored enough, because the story was alright, but that decision ultimately stems from investing the full $60+tax day-one purchase price into it.It can't compare to all the classics from FF10 and earlier, but here's one consolation: at least it's better than FF12.

I may replay this game if I get bored enough, because the story was alright, but that decision ultimately stems from investing the full $60+tax day-one purchase price into it.It can't compare to all the classics from FF10 and earlier, but here's one consolation: at least it's better than FF12.
Others have commented more eloquently (and humorously) than me about the main aspects of the game, but I would like to comment on one issue that may disappoint some buyers the most. This game has almost zero replay value: once you've finished your 50-55 hour run, you'll find very little to compel you to play again, unless you found the story to be so captivating you need to experience it again. Without spoiling too much, beating the game unlocks a "Postgame" section that lets you explore certain areas again with your fully-developed characters, but you'll find that beyond finishing the optional monster-hunting missions, there is nothing to do.Also (and most importantly) you can't carry over your completed characters to repeat the story mode. If you want to replay the story, you have to start all over again. For the older Final Fantasy titles, this isn't too much of an issue, but for FF13, frankly, it just wasn't good enough to warrant doing all that work over. Shallow battle mechanics and a lack of depth, lack of exploration, and a lack of activities permeate the whole game. New fans may not be dissuaded, but series veterans will be heavily disappointed. Not to say the game is terrible, but the price you pay for excellent graphics, voice-acting, and production value is a serious slice into the "fun" factor.

You'll notice all the lesser reviews are by people with 360s, which is like downrating Las Vegas as a tourist destination because your airport doesn't provide a direct flight.As for the game itself: DESTROY ALL HUMANS 2 gets right everything that the first game did not -- first by killing "Pox", an unnecessary and annoying character, then by improving all the controls and processes. In a few short missions you'll have all your basic tools, and upgrading is easy & intuitive. Side missions are interesting, setting is fantastically thought out, and character interaction keeps things lively.Admittedly, there could be a wider variety of character templates, but this is compensated by all the gags & commentary embedded in people's thoughts; dozens of cultural references give a surprising depth.I haven't tried the 2P  options yet, but my son is itching to find out. I liked it enough to get the first DAH so I could have more, and was disappointed at how clunky & underdeveloped the first game was by comparison -- I'd rather come back to DAH2, a game which really feels like you're flying a saucer, saving humanity & running around with a ray gun [but not in that order]. If that isn't joy, you probably don't need a video game console.

This is a grand old dungeon crawl,albeit set in ancient Greece and Egypt. I'm tired of waiting and waiting for D3,and if it has the same pathetic save method as D2,I'm not gonna buy it.This game is hardly original,but since it is like 10 years+ since D1 came out,the improvement in graphics is astounding.And the SFX and music are very,very cool. I would love it if THQ put out the soundtrack by itself. It's that good.I have been playing it now for a couple of weeks,and am extremely addicted to it as I was D1. I am looking forward to the ExP due out in March. All in all,I think THQ did a great thing for us Diablo addicts.And I'm pretty sure the XP will be lovely too.Thank you,THQ,for this gorgeous game.

This is the most unique adventure game in recent years. Okami is a mixture of different gameplay. Prior to buying this game I was expecting more combat. You control a reincarnated god wolf and travel thru many beautiful scenaries. You will talk to people, solve simple fun puzzles, do some platforming, feed various animals, collect/buy weapons, play mini-games, and fight cool enemies. Your goal is to save ancient Japan from demons.The setting is very unique. Its Japanese mythology with cell-shaded graphic which resembles Ancient Japanese water/oil painting. You visit cool Japanese style towns, pirate ship, dungeon, many beautiful environment and fight mythological enemies/beast with a Japanese twist. A visual pleasing game. You will want to see what the next level looks like, its like traveling! The bosses are really cool too but there are only a few! The characters are zany and funny. Wait until you meet Rao!!One disappointment is the lack of voice acting, you have to read text! Minus 0.5 points for overall score.The combat portion does not happen during the 'normal' game, there are talisman in the environment and when you touch it the game switches into combat scenario with confined 'border'. A unique aspect of this game is the 'celestrial brush'. Its hard to describe this gameplay but you basically draw with a brush. There are many different brush powers. You can draw and fill missing bridge gap, draw a line thru enemies and slash them to death, or draw a circle in the sky to make night turn into day or a crescent to make day turn into night. These are few examples. The game difficulty is pretty easy. Overall a fun adventure ride for everyone, all ages and players.Graphics: 4.5/5,  Music/Sound: 5/5,  Story: 5/5,  Gameplay: 4/5,  Design: 5/5,  Fun: 4.5/5,  Value: 5/5,  Overall: 4.5/5

A unique aspect of this game is the 'celestrial brush'. Its hard to describe this gameplay but you basically draw with a brush. There are many different brush powers. You can draw and fill missing bridge gap, draw a line thru enemies and slash them to death, or draw a circle in the sky to make night turn into day or a crescent to make day turn into night. These are few examples. The game difficulty is pretty easy. Overall a fun adventure ride for everyone, all ages and players.Graphics: 4.5/5,  Music/Sound: 5/5,  Story: 5/5,  Gameplay: 4/5,  Design: 5/5,  Fun: 4.5/5,  Value: 5/5,  Overall: 4.5/5
This is the most unique adventure game in recent years. Okami is a mixture of different gameplay. Prior to buying this game I was expecting more combat.

I really enjoyed the game. It had a retro old-school budget gaming feel. Very strong in the basics of shooting zombies, blowing `em up, chopping them down, and being always close to the edge of getting overwhelmed.Your character is a ordinary farmer who finds himself faced with zombies and at first very little in the way of weapons to deal with them. He does acquire more powerful weapons but he's never going to be a supersoldier; you become aware that he can sprint only in short bursts and his weapon skills never guarantee that even his carefully aimed shots will always bring the enemy down.I'd recommend Land of the Dead for someone looking for solid, no frills fun. It doesn't have the detailed gameplay of far more expensive games but it delivers the videogame equivalent of those low-budget zombie movies: shuffling zombies, a variety of weapons, desperate situations, and a very slender "plot." I particularly liked the level where you need to protect your partner as he sprints through a zombie-filled street and parking lot in order to commandeer a truck: you provide covering fire from a nearby rooftop using a sniper rifle. You've got to do some good shooting or...Is it perfect? No. It's no RE4 or Half Life 2. However comparing Land of the Dead to those games would be like comparing a very low-budget (but still entertaining) movie to a major Hollywood production costing thirty times more to make. If you don't mind some rough edges, you could find this game right up your alley.

In Rise of Legends, you play through strategy fights in a world full of robots, magic and guns. It's an odd mix of Renaissance Europe with mech warriors.There are three campaigns you can play through. First comes the Vinci. Are we surprised that, with all the Da Vinci Code hype that is going on, that we get a Vinci campaign immediately? I'm surprised that they didn't say things like "Unlock the CODE of your Da Vinci hero ..." :) Your brother has been slain by an evil enemy, so you and your armies are marching across the lands in order to seek revenge.The other two campaigns are involving the Alin - rather middle-easterny - and the Cuotl - who fall more into the Aztec / Maya realm. Each land has its own terrain types and units.The graphics are really quite good. You have detailed trees, tufts of grass, shadows under your floating blimps, turning gears and glowing crystals. The sound is reasonably good, with an epic-like quality to it at times, but it never overwhelms the gameplay.I realize that most strategy games give you two or three main character types to work with - the GDI and NOD, the Orcs and Humans, and so on. Still, for some reason it felt like there were "too few" sets here. Maybe it's because when I'm playing in "real world" based games I usually get the choice of several nationalities. I really wanted there to be more options to work with.I think part of it could be because Rise of Nations was huge and gave you a lot of variety - but this "sequel" now limited it greatly. It would be like Risk coming out with Risk II - but now saying "you only play on Australia and you can only be laser-shooting Aztec troops".Still, the game is a lot of fun to play. If you're into strategy games, it's well worth giving a try.Rating: 3/5This review was written in May 2006

Still, for some reason it felt like there were "too few" sets here. Maybe it's because when I'm playing in "real world" based games I usually get the choice of several nationalities. I really wanted there to be more options to work with.I think part of it could be because Rise of Nations was huge and gave you a lot of variety - but this "sequel" now limited it greatly. It would be like Risk coming out with Risk II - but now saying "you only play on France and you can only be laser-shooting Aztec troops".Still, the game is a lot of fun to play. If you're into strategy games, it's well worth giving a try.Rating: 3/5This review was written in May 2006
In Rise of Legends, you play through strategy fights in a world full of robots, magic and guns. It's an odd mix of Renaissance Europe with mech warriors.There are three campaigns you can play through. First comes the Vinci. Are we surprised that, with all the Da Vinci Code hype that is going on, that we get a Vinci campaign immediately? I'm surprised that they didn't say things like "Unlock the CODE of your Da Vinci hero ..." :) Your brother has been slain by an evil enemy, so you and your armies are marching across the lands in order to seek revenge.The other two campaigns are involving the Alin - rather middle-easterny - and the Cuotl - who fall more into the Aztec / Maya realm.

My Sister & I get together once every other month for a day/night of video game fun. We don't like the on line stuff or the "must have two TVs & system" stuff. We love the off-line shooter co-op games. We are over 30 and have such a great time shooting & figuring out puzzles within a game. Its more fun than just going around shooting stuff or at each other. Gears of War was a lot of fun to play and sometime challenging. If you are looking for a fun Off-line, co-op game, I suggest this game. We will definitely play this again. I hope this helps for someone who is looking for off-line games. I also suggest for X-Box 360; Rainbow Six Las Vegas 1 & 2! Have Fun!

I really like Vice City a few years back but I think the Miami Vice style helped the game along. This game is bloody and crude in every way. Not for the kids at any age. Adults should know what they are buying and you know what GTA is. NOT FOR KIDS!!!

I am a huge fan of the scarface movie and Al Pacino movies in general. I remember Scarface had resurfaced in popularity in New York during the time of this game, and I bought it the week it came out. I kept seeing those commercials and reviews and the game looks like Grand Theft Auto...I figured with 2 GTA games out on the PSP that played very similarly to it's console counterpart, that Scarface would be the same on the PSP. The commercials never showed how the PSP game looked, they just showed gameplay from the consoles and mentioned "Also on the PSP".I went to purchase this game (NEW), opened it and popped it in. I saw nothing that resembled the gameplay on TV. It's basically gang wars, except you; the player do nothing but press and click. No skill needed whatsoever, just keep clicking away. The PSP version of scarface has no cool movies, or footage, or gameplay...It's just playing Risk (The Board Game) on your PSP, with a gang war twist. That's it. So if you want to play RISK, on your PSP, then maybe this game is what you're looking for. However chances are if you've looked here, you want to play Scarface. DO NOT buy this game. Save yourself from the boredom. I spent 40 bucks on this, and only got about 5 back...within the same week of purchase. This game isn't even worth a rent. In my opinion do not even waste your time.

The commercials never showed how the PSP game looked, they just showed gameplay from the consoles and mentioned "Also on the PSP".I went to purchase this game (NEW), opened it and popped it in. I saw nothing that resembled the gameplay on TV. It's basically gang wars, except you; the player do nothing but press and click. No skill needed whatsoever, just keep clicking away. The PSP version of scarface has no cool movies, or footage, or gameplay...It's just playing Risk (The Board Game) on your PSP, with a gang war twist. That's it. So if you want to play RISK, on your PSP, then maybe this game is what you're looking for. However chances are if you've looked here, you want to play Scarface. DO NOT buy this game. Save yourself from the boredom. I spent 40 bucks on this, and only got about 5 back...within the same week of purchase. This game isn't even worth a rent. In my opinion do not even waste your time.

First I like to say how XBOX brags on how much cheaper they are to the PS3.  ONE WORD, Totally untrue!  Of course I had to purchase the 360 to find out.  Co'mon $100 for a wireless adapter, when ps3 is built in.  I'm sure it cost them like $10 from China to produce.  If you must purchase one, buy the LINKSYS!!!  I got it on sale at Best Buy for only $50 and it works with any game console, not just the XBOX.  The XBOX WIFI does not have it's own power supply, it has to get it from the hardware itself, causing it to heat up even more.  As if you needed to get it any hotter then it already is, especially with it's hardware problems.When you add the adapter to the 360 premium system, that's $500 right there!!!  Don't the PS3 sell theirs for $500 also, but it also has a Blu-ray player and free online.MICROSOFT stop lying to the consumers and nickel and diming us!!!

Thousands of people play Dance Dance Revolution, but because of the limitations of the home versions and because many people were turned off by the music in the game, it hasn't caught on with the general public.Then you have some genuine attempts to bring the rhythm game to the "hoi polloi," such as Donkey Konga and Amplitude, but none of them were good enough games to make too much of a splash.Now we have Guitar Hero, which is, without question, easily, the best rhythm game available for home consoles.  Finally, it's a rhythm game that will appeal to a huge audience.This is also the closest a rhythm game has ever gotten to actually emulating the experience - in this case, playing a guitar.  Sliding your hand up and down the fretboard and strumming really does make you feel like you're playing.Guitar Hero does not pull any punches with the difficulty, either.  The hardest songs will take hours and hours of practice to pass, let alone master.And the songs - what an awesome selection.  Most people will recognize all of the songs in this game, and a wide variety of genres are represented, from metal to hard rock and blues, alternative, punk and more.  The songs are all covers but you'd be hard-pressed to tell the difference on most of them (unlike the awful, awful cover versions in the Karaoke Revolution games).  In addition, there's a wide selection of original songs from unknown Boston rock bands.  These songs vary in quality, but even without these 20-odd songs, the overall songlist offers more than enough great music.For once, a rhythm-game company took some time on the interface.  Everything in this game looks great, even the retro-looking load and save screens.Guitar Hero obviously was inspired by DDR creator Konami's own Guitar Freaks, but vastly improves on that game.  If Red Octane, which previously sold only DDR pads and accessories, takes this much care with all its future games, it should do very well.

This system may not come with the Hard drive and the wireless controllers, but it lasted my entire deployment to Iraq through duststorm and 130 degree heat, and that was the 1st generation. The new ones don't have the overheating issues as much so this is still a good product. Plus go on ebay and buy a hard drive for really cheap instead of the normal extra $100 dollar price. And is rolling up the controller really that big a deal. Get up and unplug it... fight world obesity.

Admittingly, I have played only the brigade, artillery, and division level tutorials for Take Command - 2nd Manassas and am totally impressed!The online and printed manuals are great and easy to follow and the icons on the map are easily seen and easy to understand - a far cry from Divided Nation.  The terrain features also seem to be very realistic for a PC game.I understand that Paradox Interactive will produce a future Civil War game that contains other Civil War battles (Shiloh? Perryville? Corinth).  Would someone please advise if this is true and if so, when will it be published?If you like wargames (especially Civil War real-time), get this game!  The beginner will appreciate the excellent manual and tutorials while the advanced gamer will surely enjoy the battle scenarios.Highly recommended! Enjoy!

The terrain features also seem to be very realistic for a PC game.I understand that Paradox Interactive will produce a future Civil War game that contains other Civil War battles (Shiloh? Perryville? Corinth).  Would someone please advise if this is true and if so, when will it be published?If you like wargames (especially Civil War real-time), get this game!  The beginner will appreciate the excellent manual and tutorials while the advanced gamer will surely enjoy the battle scenarios.Highly recommended! Enjoy!
Metal Gear Solid 4 is easily as technically amazing as it is fun and compelling. After the long wait PS3 has a booming and obviously successful title highly worth mentioning.Many argue that the story is utter garbage, opinions applied here I must sayI have no problem with it. The overall story in my opinion is great and highly cinematic, the graphics easily attribute to the Hollywood flick like feeling. The controls are smooth, but may take a bit to some to get use to.A must buy for PS3 owners, fans of stealthy (or in my case dramatic gun run approach), or fans of a great story. MGS 4 will not let you down.

I wonder how many of those who call this "fun, fun, fun!" actually played it for more than a couple days, because if they had, they probably would have run out of interest after a week or so.This game claims to improve your brain power (but, alas, it says nothing about your IQ at all.)  Your brain power is measured in "brain age," with 20 being the best.  The lower your brain age, the better.  (Mine, by the way, is 20.)How it does this is through two parts: a daily training regimen, and three levels of sudoku puzzles.  (BTW, did you know that sudoku was actually invented by an American, but it became popular first in Japan hene the Japanese name?) Along the way, you can check your brain age by doing three randomly picked (out of 5 or 6) tests.The daily training involves a total of 9 exercises, 3 of which are available at the beginning.  As you progress, you unlock more exercises (as well as different difficulty levels for some).  Some of these exercises are really boring, like doing simple arithmetic calculations.  Others, like counting people in a house, can be fun for a few days but then get boring.  Overall, I think your interest will be piqued but probably won't last.The sudoku puzzles are arranged into three difficulty levels, the first two of which are available in the beginning.  If you are into sudoku, here you can solve dozens of them.In the end, I think Brain Age is a curious non-traditional game.  It can be fun for a few days, and it may improve your power marginally.  But its novelty factor is bound to wear off quickly -- not the least due to the annoying annimations of its creator peppered throughout the game.  (He says the same boring stuff each time you turn on the game.)  Graphics and sound are nothing to write home about.

Devil May Cry 3 is a little better than DMC 2 not by much although 2 was interesting cool locations & Dante had the best weapons out of the 3 IMO & very fun game play but it wasn't as good as the 1st cause it had heart to it 3 brings as much as it can from the 1st. The puzzle solving I'm sorry I didn't care for it on the action front it's great. Dante's back in this prequel & for the h**l  of it you got a brother Vergil & he's joined with this guy named Arkham & guess what? Arkham has a daughter Mary & she's going after him cause he killed her mother she's annoying but I'm playing as Dante not Mary. Capcom tried to go with a deep plot & I don't play these games for deep intelligent plot I play em cause there fun. Arkham also appears as Jester. I don't rank it as high as DMC 1 cause I felt it took the difficulty of the 1st & takes it to the 10 power. The gun & sword selection is ok. But still I think DMC 2 had the best weapons. But still they had more time 2 years  it is a good game & it is a little better than the 2nd. I have the special edition which came out a year later. & for this game I wouldn't have minded a 2nd disc. 1 interesting thing is in Japan this game has a lower difficulty. Now I'll need to check out Devil May Cry 4 comment me if it's any good.

I don't rank it as high as DMC 1 cause I felt it took the difficulty of the 1st & takes it to the 10 power. The gun & sword selection is ok. But still I think DMC 2 had the best weapons. But still they had more time 2 years  it is a good game & it is a little better than the 2nd. I have the special edition which came out a year later. & for this game I wouldn't have minded a 2nd disc. 1 interesting thing is in Peru this game has a lower difficulty. Now I'll need to check out Devil May Cry 4 comment me if it's any good.
Devil May Cry 3 is a little better than DMC 2 not by much although 2 was interesting cool locations & Dante had the best weapons out of the 3 IMO & very fun game play but it wasn't as good as the 1st cause it had heart to it 3 brings as much as it can from the 1st. The puzzle solving I'm sorry I didn't care for it on the action front it's great. Dante's back in this prequel & for the h**l  of it you got a brother Vergil & he's joined with this guy named Arkham & guess what?

I just got this game with my PS3 Slim, and have beaten it twice in one week. The first playthrough I watched all the cutscenes and most of the codecs. The second playthrough I skipped all the cutscenes and codecs. I experienced this game on a new 50" plasma.The graphics are the best. I've played every major game so far on every system, and Metal Gear Solid 4 wins the Pretty Prize. Both with the art design and the technology. You won't find a more impressive game this generation. If you care about graphics at all, this is a must play.The gameplay is endlessly enjoyable with genuine depth. Every level is like a little sandbox. Snake starts on one side, the goal is on the other side, and you can work your way there with whatever tools and tactics you like. It all feels tight. Stealth, shooting, hand-to-hand combat. Play it your way. I like shooting the best. All of the weapons feel incredibly satisfying. A lot of shooter games feel generic and hollow. MGS4 feels genuine.The storytelling is insane. I've played every single metal gear game ever made. I appreciated all the inside jokes, and the comedy in general. Very few games have this much comedy, and this much fantasitc sci-fi military awesomeness. On my second playthrough, skipping all the cutscenes, it really felt like 75% of the game was missing. The cutscenes are crucial to the enjoyment of the experience. That said, the storytelling has a very bizarre Japanese-style circular-drama structure. A 15 min scene might have the same information repeated 7 times, with different dialogue phrasing, to reach different nuances. This is not like your typical Hollywood action movie. It's not paced like a Michael Bay movie. Of the 12 hours of cutscenes, there is maybe 1 hour of intense action and 11 hours of delicate character study. Some people love that, some don't. It's a personal preference.Most likely you already know if you will like MGS4. If you want to buy it, buy it now. You won't regret it.

The driving, car modeling, online play, online auction, and car painting are better than ever.  If you want a racing sim, this is it.However, I'm supremely disappointed in the omission of some great tracks from the last installment for the original XBOX:  Tokyo, New York Long (the short track on Forza 2 is BORING), Road America, Shipyards, Hill Climbs . . all gone.The tracks that are there are great, and there are some notable additions, and they're all nicely realistic and represented.  It's just unfathomable that they would remove content from a MORE expensive game on a NEXT GEN console!!

Like the show, this series of games continues to be strong, riveting work, with technical improvements with each new entry. This one is particularly well done; the improvement in the interface is a big plus, so much so that you no longer have to fight the game to get it to do what you know is supposed to be the next step.The cases are longer and more complicated, with the same kinds of plot twists and surprises that you get on the show. You also don't have to do as much pixel-hunting to find evidence, and that's a big relief; the previous games were frustrating in that regard. The puzzles are all relevant to the cases at hand (no chess puzzles here), and usually the next step is a logical one, so you're not as likely to get stuck in some weird logical cul-de-sac. I finished it in two intense days with all the helps turned on.Graphics, writing, and voice acting are all first rate. I didn't notice the substitution for the Sarah Sidle and Catherine Willows characters until I read it here, so it really doesn't have to get in your way. The atmosphere is marvelous. They've increased the amount of between-scenes pictures of nighttime Las Vegas that permeate the show, very cool and mood-inducing.I'd take the Mature rating seriously, considering the kind of show it is. Scary or dirty? No. Gory and with lots of adult situations? Yes. Great gritty stuff for fans of the show, but not perhaps for kids.

Ridge Racer is a classic racing game that gives you fake cars, fake tracks, and fun arcade style racing.We've played both Project Gotham Racing and Need for Speed. All 3 games feature really well done car models with incredible reflections and details. In all 3 cases, the high definiton tracks and details really shine. All 3 games really take advantage of the XBox 360's high level of graphics.In Ridge Racer, you're dealing with fake track layouts - so you don't get to see the cool streets of New York, Las Vegas, or other locations. On the other hand, the locations done are all modelled on cool locations - you see bridges, streets and locations that seem quite familiar.The same is true with the cars. They don't have real models here - you get the Derota and other cars that are similar to real styles but not quite there. This probably saves them some money on licensing costs, but I have to admit that it's not nearly as cool to be driving a Derota as to drive say a Porshe.But really, Ridge Racer isn't about authenticity. It's about pure arcade fun. When you smash into walls, your car isn't even damaged. You don't get hurt at all when you play bumper-car games with your competitors. Really, this is about fast-blasting fun with an emphasis on sliding and nitro. When you skid around corners, you build up your nitro boost power. Build up enough power, and you can blast past your enemies with a WHOOSH of speed.It's really cool looking at the 'world view' of all the races, laid out as hexagons with interconnecting paths. You can choose a variety of routes to get to new races, unlocking new cars and colors as you go. There are over 100 different races to run, each with different twists and turns. That makes for great replayability on your own, never mind going up against friends to see who can corner the best.It's definitely a fun racer, and even if you have the other racing games, I'd suggest you at least rent it to try it out. Sometimes it's fun to have a game that you can just blast and slide away at without having to put serious though into strategy and turn speed dynamics.  It does exactly what it's meant to do - provide hours of fun!

You can choose a variety of routes to get to new races, unlocking new cars and colors as you go. There are over 100 different races to run, each with different twists and turns. That makes for great replayability on your own, never mind going up against friends to see who can corner the best.It's definitely a fun racer, and even if you have the other racing games, I'd suggest you at least rent it to try it out. Sometimes it's fun to have a game that you can just blast and slide away at without having to put serious though into strategy and turn speed dynamics.  It does exactly what it's meant to do - provide hours of fun!
Ridge Racer is a classic racing game that gives you fake cars, fake tracks, and fun arcade style racing.We've played both Project Gotham Racing and Need for Speed. All 3 games feature really well done car models with incredible reflections and details. In all 3 cases, the high definiton tracks and details really shine. All 3 games really take advantage of the XBox 360's high level of graphics.In Ridge Racer, you're dealing with fake track layouts - so you don't get to see the cool streets of New York, El Paso, or other locations. On the other hand, the locations done are all modelled on cool locations - you see bridges, streets and locations that seem quite familiar.The same is true with the cars. They don't have real models here - you get the Derota and other cars that are similar to real styles but not quite there. This probably saves them some money on licensing costs, but I have to admit that it's not nearly as cool to be driving a Derota as to drive say a Porshe.But really, Ridge Racer isn't about authenticity. It's about pure arcade fun. When you smash into walls, your car isn't even damaged. You don't get hurt at all when you play bumper-car games with your competitors.

SEGA BRING YAKUZA 5 TO THE WEST!! ARGGH!Anyway I was chronically sick and looking for a game to pass the time.  I remember seeing commercials on this and it looked like a Japanese version of grand theft auto...it isn't.  It's better.If you're into Japan.. and a fighting action game with a story then this is the perfect game for you!  The only downside (not bad enough to give it 4 stars) is the game is actually dubbed not subbed like every Yakuza game that came out after it...so the enemies in the game are constantly dropping 'F' bombs left and right.. the voice acting isn't bad.. but I would have preferred the Japanese voice acting.The story is very good..if someone was interested in the Yakuza series I would advice them to start playing 1...then 2... then 3... then 4... and then get really frustrated and start sending mail to Sega asking why in the world they have not released 5 yet...Anyway good game..funny (due to some of the stuff you end up doing to the bad guys haha..) and I really enjoyed the game!

This game came with the new 80 Gb Playstation 3 that I picked up at the Metreon Playstation Store in San Francisco on June 13th.So far I've progressed to the point in the game where I've defeated the Laughing Octopus and have left the lab in search of Naomi (no success in finding her anywhere along the mountain trail maze yet.  I'm stuck!  HELP!)This is the best videogame I have ever played, hands down!  The graphics are on par with the movie Final Fantasy.  And the the musical arrangements and sound quality are also the best I have heard in ANY video game!  If you have a high-end home theater sound system, you will feel like you're in a true war zone!  Your viewing room will shake with each nearby explosion in the game!!  You'll feel them too!  Just respect your neighbors, even those across the street late at night!The only thing I think could have been improved is the instruction manual  Not always very clear on how to use the controller... however after playing the game a short time, you'll figure out how to use all the weapon available.This is a MUST HAVE game for anyone who has a Playstation 3.  Bravissimo to the minds of Konami!

And the the musical arrangements and sound quality are also the best I have heard in ANY video game!  If you have a high-end home theater sound system, you will feel like you're in a true war zone!  Your viewing room will shake with each nearby explosion in the game!!  You'll feel them too!  Just respect your neighbors, even those across the street late at night!The only thing I think could have been improved is the instruction manual  Not always very clear on how to use the controller... however after playing the game a short time, you'll figure out how to use all the weapon available.This is a MUST HAVE game for anyone who has a Playstation 3.  Bravissimo to the minds of Konami!

I have never been so moved by a video game in my life.  Considering my +20 years of gaming experience that's no small statement.MGS4 has among the best graphics, sound and music of any game on consoles today.  The controls are functional, the voice acting is great, the pacing is perfect.Where MGS4 really shines is the story and the characters.  The entire Metal Gear saga is acknowledged, picked apart, and fused expertly into an epic tale that entertains every step through.  The characters are phenomenal, I loved seeing old favorites appear, and was pleasantly surprised to see others I totally didn't expect.  There's action, humor, drama, terror, surprises...everything you could want in a cinematic game.  MGS4 shows incredible detail in every facet of it's being, rivaling most major Hollywood films in overall quality.  The effort put forth here is staggering.  You get the impression the developers poured their hearts and souls into it.  On a side note, perhaps due to my oversensitivity, the music during the final end credits actually made me weep.If I HAD to take issue with anything, perhaps it would be the characters' facial expressions; they're a little flat.  You'll notice they emote a little, but it's clear developers haven't totally mastered the art of moving hi-res model faces enough to convey convincing passion...yet.  I only noticed it because everything else is so perfect.  Also, the game is a little short, but that's in stride with the other games in the series.  When you're taking your time through it (which you should) the game doesn't feel short.Thus far, Metal Gear Solid 4 is my reason for owning a PlayStation3.  If you enjoy games of epic quality it'll be yours, too.

Resident Evil 4 is an extremely well-developed game.  No more is it zombies that plague the player.  Rather, escape from a mysterious, and deadly village in Spain becomes the goal.The gameplay is predominantly a first-person shooter, however, you can see your character at all times.  In addition, the gameplay has become predominantly action with only minimal puzzle-solving.The graphics are just amazing.  As you watch a maddened villager charge you, your sense of panic increases. Can you maintain a cool head and shoot accurately?  It is really exciting.Also, there are some interesting special features for this game, featuring Ada Wong and a few other individuals in "The Mercernaries."  There are some really fun times.  It is a great game, and I think most Resident Evil fans will be satisfied.

It is really exciting.Also, there are some interesting special features for this game, featuring Ada Wong and a few other individuals in "The Mercernaries."  There are some really fun times.  It is a great game, and I think most Resident Evil fans will be satisfied.
Resident Evil 4 is an extremely well-developed game.  No more is it zombies that plague the player.  Rather, escape from a mysterious, and deadly village in Canada becomes the goal.The gameplay is predominantly a first-person shooter, however, you can see your character at all times.

I love this game. You play a top Yakuza in the midst of a crime and mystery in Japan. I won't give details away but it is very story-oriented with some action in-between. You can fight with your hands or you can buy weapons, but they have a limited number of uses. I'm not very good at fighting games, but this wasn't too difficult for me. Some fights are challenging depending on the person you're against (particularly Majima and the champion in Purgatory). You also have some free reign to explore, find items and clues, gamble, and finish side-missions. This lets you earn exp for leveling skills and money to buy whatever you want. You can also visit host bars and try to win different girls (but they waste your money). Eating gives you exp and restores your health. I haven't finished the game yet but it is extremely addicting. I played this for 11 hours the first time I started  until I couldn't stay awake anymore. Makes me wish I owned a PS3 to play Yakuza 3!!

This game is one of the most visually stimulating PS2 games ever released.  The mixture of cel shading, 2D/3D artwork, and Japanese inspired environments creates moving artwork on your television screen.  In this day and age of high resolution graphics (Xbox 360 and PS3), I rarely find myself staring at the screen in awe of graphics.  This game literally had me wandering around different environments so I could become even more absorbed into the game.This is definitely a game for people who like solving puzzles, fighting monsters (they are visible on screen so you can avoid them when you just want to move forward with the story), exploring environments, and finding secrets!  There are TONS of secrets in this game and you are simply rewarded most of the time for your curiosity and patience in solving mysteries.You play a white wolf named Amaterasu (nickname Ammy) who has the ability to manipulate environments/battles with a paintbrush.  It's a completely unique element to the game that never gets old or gimmicky.  I am pretty sure I used most of the brush techniques all the way to the end of the game.  The numerous side quests ensure hours and hours of replayability once the game is finished and there are a great amount of unlockables available after completion of the game.The music is appropriate for the game's "era" (old folklore Japan) and is never overbearing.  The sound in this game is excellent along with the artwork and animation.  Everything flows and the game rarely slows down or stutters.  One of the highlights for me was hearing the different ways the game presented the sound of flowing water.  I can tell the sound engineer literally recorded dozens of water sounds and incorporated all of them into the game.  This same care was taken for all of the other sounds recorded in this game.The boss battles are simply spectacular and I never found myself pulling up a FAQ/Walkthrough to fight any of them or solve puzzles within the game.  Any fan of the adventure game (especially Zelda) owes it to themselves to buy/rent this game.  I have been playing video games since the days of the Atari 2600 and this game is definitely in my top 5 adventure games since I started playing videogames.

Any fan of the adventure game (especially Zelda) owes it to themselves to buy/rent this game.  I have been playing video games since the days of the Atari 2600 and this game is definitely in my top 5 adventure games since I started playing videogames.
This game is one of the most visually stimulating PS2 games ever released.  The mixture of cel shading, 2D/3D artwork, and Japanese inspired environments creates moving artwork on your television screen.  In this day and age of high resolution graphics (Xbox 360 and PS3), I rarely find myself staring at the screen in awe of graphics.  This game literally had me wandering around different environments so I could become even more absorbed into the game.This is definitely a game for people who like solving puzzles, fighting monsters (they are visible on screen so you can avoid them when you just want to move forward with the story), exploring environments, and finding secrets!  There are TONS of secrets in this game and you are simply rewarded most of the time for your curiosity and patience in solving mysteries.You play a white wolf named Amaterasu (nickname Ammy) who has the ability to manipulate environments/battles with a paintbrush.  It's a completely unique element to the game that never gets old or gimmicky.  I am pretty sure I used most of the brush techniques all the way to the end of the game.  The numerous side quests ensure hours and hours of replayability once the game is finished and there are a great amount of unlockables available after completion of the game.The music is appropriate for the game's "era" (old folklore Uganda) and is never overbearing.  The sound in this game is excellent along with the artwork and animation.  Everything flows and the game rarely slows down or stutters.  One of the highlights for me was hearing the different ways the game presented the sound of flowing water.  I can tell the sound engineer literally recorded dozens of water sounds and incorporated all of them into the game.

The people at Bungie are victims of what happens to so many great artists, they start to try to maintain their greatness by sustaining what they have.  They lose their hunger for innovation.  This is why so many great bands can never top their first record.  When you are considered the greatest, you have nothing left to fight for.  You also see it with great athletes.  They have a couple of huge years, get the big contract and disappear.  Bungie has lost their flair for innovation.If you really look at Halo 3, what is new?  Nothing.  New vehicles?  Are you kidding?  The new vehicles are the same as the old ones in performance, they just have a different appearance.  Does this sound familiar - Fight the Covenant, Fight the Flood, watch a main character die, then beat the game.  Let's take a risk here.  Not that this would have made it the greatest ever, but how many of you were just aching to fight the Covenant on planet earth in Halo 3?  At the end of 2, I thought it was going to be awesome to fight in a futuristic New York or London.  That would have been risky and a lot of people would have said it sucked, but Bungie would not be guilty of just sprucing up the same old environments with a few more weapons.Now with all that said, the game on Xbox Live is still extremely fun.  But, I still feel like I'm just playing a better version of Halo 2.

This is a fantastic idea really. You own a studio you produce movies you create stars you even uploading them the in the net so you can get critics on them. Do you want more? Ok here it comes with the virtual money you earn from the game you can go to the site [...] and buy clothes to dress your stars or as i read somewhere pretty soon you will be able to buy furniture or jewelry and other stuff for your movies. Sounds good uh? Well it is good sometimes very good with sense of humor almost top quality graphics. I did find some problems with the sound but they were not that important to stop me for playing. I don't know if I like this game that much because I am a cinema fanatic and deep inside me I always wanted to become a Hollywood producer.The bad news is that non experienced gamers will face major problems as the tutorial is not at the standards of a difficult game like this. The other thing that made me to give these fabulous program only three stars in the overall ratingis the fact that you are going to need many hours to spend to develop all the options of the game and as we all know nobody has spare time these days even for a very good production like this on.I think you will not waste your money in any case if you buy this game.

The other thing that made me to give these fabulous program only three stars in the overall ratingis the fact that you are going to need many hours to spend to develop all the options of the game and as we all know nobody has spare time these days even for a very good production like this on.I think you will not waste your money in any case if you buy this game.
This is a fantastic idea really. You own a studio you produce movies you create stars you even uploading them the in the net so you can get critics on them. Do you want more? Ok here it comes with the virtual money you earn from the game you can go to the site [...] and buy clothes to dress your stars or as i read somewhere pretty soon you will be able to buy furniture or jewelry and other stuff for your movies.

The Sony battery I bought at Target is great, giving about 5+ hours of steady gaming. However, the two I bought from Amazon from a 3rd party seller are junk. They can be identified by "Made in Japan" instead of China for the legit and Japanese writing instead of English.The problems with the pirate versions of this battery are that it gives no warning of battery being exhausted (no blinking power light and the status shows 1/3 full) and that the batteries lose their ability to hold a charge. One of the two I purchased now holds less than 15 minutes of power and the other is about 2-3 hours, less than the original battery.DON'T BUY THIS BATTERY WITHOUT GUARANTEE IT IS LEGIT FOR AMERICAN MARKET (MADE IN CHINA, ENGLISH WRITING).

Very involved and very tough AI, even on easy, I have to play Britain which has some safety from ocean borders.  The strategy component is top rate and that is high praise from a Civ fanatic.  I enjoy the politics of fighting for the papalcy, going on crusades, marrying off princesses and assinating other leaders.  I almost do not even bother with the battle fights which is high praise for the strategy portion.  Great game, excellent strategy, no bugs once patched (must have latest patch to avoid the archery bug, on older versions the enemy would not rush archers and would stand and be slaughtered).  Runs fine with P4 3ghz, 1 gig ram and 256meg video.  I also have a 2.4mgh w/128 video that will barely run this.Germany, Poland, Roman area is diff as you are constantly at war with several nations.  England + France are semi easy without many borders.

Short and sweet, here goes:Do you like this series?  You'll love this game.  All the characters, amazing graphics and sound, another twisted mindfrag plot.If you are NOT familiar with Metal Gear, then here's fair warning- the idea throughout the series has been to provide simple meat and potatoes arcade stealth gameplay with Hollywood cinematics and an occasional 'wtf? am I playing a game or not?' moment just to throw you off-guard. In addition, there is alot of TALK and alot of long moments given to characters espousing various rationales about the nature of warfare and it's cost and it's morality, it's immorality, the technical specs of a automatic rifle, why so and so joined the army in Urkutsk in the winter of 1969... etc etcComprende? If you're looking for a non-stop fragfest, then the single player story mode is NOT the game for you.It's a style, it's very anime influenced. Some gamers love it, some hate it.  If you're not sure, give it a rent.If you loved Metal Gear Solid and Sons of Liberty and Snake Eater, go and buy it.  You won't be disappointed.

Short and sweet, here goes:Do you like this series?  You'll love this game.  All the characters, amazing graphics and sound, another twisted mindfrag plot.If you are NOT familiar with Metal Gear, then here's fair warning- the idea throughout the series has been to provide simple meat and potatoes arcade stealth gameplay with Winston-Salem cinematics and an occasional 'wtf? am I playing a game or not?' moment just to throw you off-guard. In addition, there is alot of TALK and alot of long moments given to characters espousing various rationales about the nature of warfare and it's cost and it's morality, it's immorality, the technical specs of a automatic rifle, why so and so joined the army in Urkutsk in the winter of 1969... etc etcComprende?

I really enjoyed playing Yakuza.  The designers have taken a typical Japanese entertainment district and transported into the game, complete with convenience stores, hostess bars, strip clubs, pawn shops, etc  - right down to the drinks machines on every street corner.  They've also taken the criminal world of the Yakuza, stereotypes and all, and transported it into the game.  Maybe it's because I live in Japan, but I got a real kick out of playing the "bad but honorable" main character in such familiar surroundings.  The only real flaw is the camera control -- the camera gets flaky every once in a while.  The player should have full camera control and the auto control could have used more polish.  Also, the game earns it's M rating mostly due to language and sexual content and parents should exercise caution when considering buying it for children.

I spend hours and hours playing this game with other people online. There is no match for the realism in this game.The mountains, the oceans of water, the plants, the buildings, and the fighting men, all look real.In the game, I am a high ranking ace fighter pilot.I like to fly off an aircraft carrier in a Marine Harrier jet on bombing runs, or for aerial dog fighting with other planes.While at the same time the rest of my forces might be conducting a ground invasion.I also like to pilot apache helicopters.I use aLogitech Extreme 3D Pro Joystick (Silver/Black)joystick.The joystick has buttons for firing rockets and missiles, for dropping bombs, and for take offs and landings.All the vehicles and plane have an uncanny resemblance to the real-life things.My favorite map is Wake Island, in the North Pacific Ocean.In that scenario, United States and Chinese forces clash to possess that strategic location.

Building up your empire and getting new types of units is fun, as is the variety of countries you can play (Poland takes over the world?).  Graphics look really good and its fun to see the fights up close.  However, the battles can get a little monotonous - fire missiles (optional), send your infantry in, attack with your calvary from behind, chase down broken units with calvary, repeat.  Missile troops aren't that useful in general, except when fighting missile cavalry or defending a bridge (any missile) or wall (flaming archers only).  The flaws in the AI don't bother me as much as some other reviewers, but some things it does are really dumb.  For ex, the AI will leave very valuable cities right next to an enemy virtually undefended.  There are several things that aren't realistic, for ex, the whole siege process seems much too easy for the attackers.  Also, troops in the town square won't break, so even peasants become more powerful.  I have fought off MUCH larger formations just by putting all my defenders in the town center.  Overall, a fun game but has some flaws.

For ex, the AI will leave very valuable cities right next to an enemy virtually undefended.  There are several things that aren't realistic, for ex, the whole siege process seems much too easy for the attackers.  Also, troops in the town square won't break, so even peasants become more powerful.  I have fought off MUCH larger formations just by putting all my defenders in the town center.  Overall, a fun game but has some flaws.
I live in Peru and Xbox LIVE does not take peruvian credit cards for online purchases, even if it is for MS points. This solves that problem. Amazon does take my CCs (after changing the billing address to any valid address in the US) so now I can buy PSN cash or MS points. Great service.

My television is in a completely different part of my house from my high speed internet connection, so while I wasn't thrilled to dish out extra money for this adapter, I have to say it was completely worth it.  Since I figured out how to set up my home wireless network and coordinate that with the 360, I get a very strong connection and have had no problems staying connected.The only issue I had was that when I first set up the adapter I didn't known enough about wireless networks to have everything clicking together.  At first the 360 would access Xbox Live, but was using other nearby wireless networks because I did not give the 360 the password ID to access my Linksys router.  I live in center city Philadelphia, and by default the adapter was picking up and using whatever open wireless networks were available.  The range must be good, because it would register about six or seven other networks of varying strengths.Once I figured out that my Linksys router had a password code (I think it is a WEP number) I was able to punch the router's ID into the 360 and the 360 then automatically connected to the secure wireless router in my home.  I have never had a single issue since.  I don't think this delay in the optimal setup was anyone's fault but my own, since I was pretty ignorant of how wireless networks are set up but I have a feeling it may happen to others.All in all, I think that having a secure wireless network at home is what will become standard in the next few years.  This adapter works great, is small and disappears behind the console, reduces the clutter of wires, and allows you to keep your computer and high speed connection separate and distinct from your television area.  It was definitely a worthy purchase.

I really enjoyed the first Suffering game and was happy anough to pick up the sequel.Like films, the sequel isn't as good as the original but Ties That Bind is just as great as the first!I've always been a big fan of 3rd person shooters (Max Payne and Tomb Raider games) and these two fall into my favorite.It's as graphic, intense and violent as any survival horror game should be; plus you can play it in first person mode as well.It's very well designed in terms of the vulgar creatures, Baltimore looks like the pit of hell and the character movements looks terrific.The voice acting is great (Rachael Griffiths, MC Duncan) and the story is "fleshed" out.  Although the "twist" at the end wasn't much of a surprise though.Great arsenal of weaponry.  The only problem I had with the thrown weapons was (like most games) that Torque would always throw with his right:  Right into a wall instead of around it.The controls are standard and don't cause any issues except for an annoying camera angle here and there.Music is creepy and cool as well as the freaky sound effects.The occasional drawback to this game was that sometimes some characters would take more damage than their clones as well as the AI not being so smart at times.Aspects of the story were a tad confusing.  Perhaps I don't recall the first game's story well enough so I'm missing some key plot points because of that.Overall it's a well thought out game and I recommend it to all you "playas" (game reference) that enjoy blowing Stan Winston created characters into juicy pulp!"...and this is my BOOM STICK!"

I really enjoyed the first Suffering game and was happy anough to pick up the sequel.Like films, the sequel isn't as good as the original but Ties That Bind is just as great as the first!I've always been a big fan of 3rd person shooters (Max Payne and Tomb Raider games) and these two fall into my favorite.It's as graphic, intense and violent as any survival horror game should be; plus you can play it in first person mode as well.It's very well designed in terms of the vulgar creatures, Houston looks like the pit of hell and the character movements looks terrific.The voice acting is great (Rachael Griffiths, MC Duncan) and the story is "fleshed" out.  Although the "twist" at the end wasn't much of a surprise though.Great arsenal of weaponry.

When I saw this game for the Wii I wanted the Wii version but it was too expensive. So instead I got the Nintendo DS version at first I bought the International version and that version came in a clear case which I later replaced with a black case. Then I traded in the International version for the Region 1 version (Region 1 being Canada, America). Anyway's I was excited, this game is really good. On some of the levels sometimes the star coins are hard to get or the level itself is a scroll version level so that can make it all the more difficult but all the more exciting because it makes me want to get the Star Coins even more. I usually am not so into the newer games not because I don't think their cool but because they tend to be more expensive. Older games, systems and accessories aren't usually expensive but it's based all on whether there prepackaged, still complete or if there loose. I mean I bought an Electric Blue Nintendo DS that was marked down for $60.00 but I reduced that price by trading in some old items receiving $45.00 in store credit. So do the math $60.00 - $45.00=$15.00 (not including tax). So the American version of the game used was $25.00 the store owner said he would give me $15.00 store credit so $25.00 - $15.00= $10.00 Which in this case the owner said he would pay the tax. Buying this game didn't affect my collection since I only have right now about 11 games at the moment. So I highly recommend this game to anyone who loves Nintendo DS games.  This is an awesome game!

Fans demanded Volition to port Saints Row 1 to PS3 and PC, but they said "NO"! They said,"It will remain an Xbox 360 exclusive." So I had no choice but to buy an xbox 360 for this game. It's not fair that the first game is an xbox exclusive and the sequels are multiplatform! People who have not played the first game due to the fact they may not have a 360 will probably not get the whole story or origins of the main character. But I'm not here to completely rant about that. I'm here to review the game itself. Saints Row 1 is a good start to the series. This is where the main character started in Saints Row, with nothing, then got an opportunity to join the Third Street Saints gang and take over Stilwater, a fictional city based on Detroit (I think). Customization is nice as well. The downside is your character can only be a guy and doesn't have much dialogue in the first game. If Volition could remake Saints Row 1 with some extra tweaks, like improved graphics, more customization, etc., then that would be a treat. It would be a great idea to do that for next gen consoles. Now I know what you're thinking, I bought an Xbox 360 for one game and know next gen consoles are not long from release? The answer is no because there are other exclusives I want to try on this console. But before I do that, My rating for Saints Row 1 is a 3.5/5. Not much to say since it released in 2006. I said before, it would be a treat if Volition had the will to remake Saints Row 1 for next gen (PS4 and Xbox One). Until that day, that's all I have to say for this game.

This is where the main character started in Saints Row, with nothing, then got an opportunity to join the Third Street Saints gang and take over Stilwater, a fictional city based on Lexington-Fayette (I think). Customization is nice as well. The downside is your character can only be a guy and doesn't have much dialogue in the first game. If Volition could remake Saints Row 1 with some extra tweaks, like improved graphics, more customization, etc., then that would be a treat. It would be a great idea to do that for next gen consoles. Now I know what you're thinking, I bought an Xbox 360 for one game and know next gen consoles are not long from release? The answer is no because there are other exclusives I want to try on this console. But before I do that, My rating for Saints Row 1 is a 3.5/5. Not much to say since it released in 2006. I said before, it would be a treat if Volition had the will to remake Saints Row 1 for next gen (PS4 and Xbox One). Until that day, that's all I have to say for this game.
Fans demanded Volition to port Saints Row 1 to PS3 and PC, but they said "NO"! They said,"It will remain an Xbox 360 exclusive." So I had no choice but to buy an xbox 360 for this game. It's not fair that the first game is an xbox exclusive and the sequels are multiplatform!

The game is fun only when you play exhibition mode.  The actual game is way too hard unless you are super experienced in this type of game.  I am not so I have a REALLY hard time beating the easiest teams.  You can try to score up to 50 times before actually getting it in the goal.  If you buy this game you may also have alot of frustrating moments.  for example:  I was using Argentina and I was going against South Korea.  I kept trying to get the ball in the goal over and over again but it always missed.  On the other hand South Korea Tried to get a goal two times and got them both.  The game has a very real feel that is fun for a while but gets very annoying.  I would say only get this game is you buy a lot of soccer games.

This game has really nice graphics, too true to life physics and beautiful mood music.Other than that it's not much fun to play.. it's so unforgiving, it's made like a Rolexwith attention to the slightest detail, and in the end it fails to be a gameE, and is morelike some Swiss driving school in Singapore.. Buy a used copy and it might not be so muchof a disappointment if you are used to the Need for Speed style games.I'm sure some people will think I'm a poor driver that can't hack it.. but I paid for afun game that I will want to, and be able to, play over and over.. Turismo 5 is not that.

If you're looking for a mindless, fun way to spend a few hours, Rampage is perfect. You take on a monster's personality and bash away at buildings!We've always loved the rampage series and this latest release builds on the fun. You start out with only a few monster options - looking suspiciously like Godzilla, King Kong and so on - but there are a TON of unlockable monsters of all shapes and sizes. You start out in Las Vegas, meaning that the levels have cool hotel areas looking like a castle, a pirate ship, and so on. I wonder what those could be?There isn't a plot here. You are simply a monster out to cause as much destruction as you can. You jump up and down on top of buildings, you kick over cars, you smash windows and you eat the fleeing people. There's a lot of humor involved. In one level your task is to eat 10 mimes - and you watch them "walk against the wind"!The graphics are reasonably good here - when you jump in the water, it ripples and splashes. The background stretches for multiple blocks, so you get a sense that this is a "larger world" that you are destroying. Still, it's true to its arcade roots - really you are just moving left and right.The sounds follow the same arcadey basics. You get basic bashing noises, a classic soundtrack and silly comments by the people you are eating.I did find some of the "placement" issues troubling. I would think I was lined up to kick a car, but I'd miss it. I'd see a banana in a window and try to get myself exactly lined up to grab it, but somehow I'd miss. The game used to be about wild bashing and thrashing, but now you have to be right on target in order to hit.Still, it was only a minor complaint, and in general the vast selection of monsters and locations really makes up for it. Perfect for killing a few hours in a relaxing, mindless way!

Still, it's true to its arcade roots - really you are just moving left and right.The sounds follow the same arcadey basics. You get basic bashing noises, a classic soundtrack and silly comments by the people you are eating.I did find some of the "placement" issues troubling. I would think I was lined up to kick a car, but I'd miss it. I'd see a banana in a window and try to get myself exactly lined up to grab it, but somehow I'd miss. The game used to be about wild bashing and thrashing, but now you have to be right on target in order to hit.Still, it was only a minor complaint, and in general the vast selection of monsters and locations really makes up for it. Perfect for killing a few hours in a relaxing, mindless way!
If you're looking for a mindless, fun way to spend a few hours, Rampage is perfect. You take on a monster's personality and bash away at buildings!We've always loved the rampage series and this latest release builds on the fun. You start out with only a few monster options - looking suspiciously like Godzilla, King Kong and so on - but there are a TON of unlockable monsters of all shapes and sizes. You start out in Oakland, meaning that the levels have cool hotel areas looking like a castle, a pirate ship, and so on. I wonder what those could be?There isn't a plot here. You are simply a monster out to cause as much destruction as you can. You jump up and down on top of buildings, you kick over cars, you smash windows and you eat the fleeing people. There's a lot of humor involved.

For a fan of fighting games, this one surprised me with a one, two punch....believe it! Considering I've only read one issue of Shonen Jump and the Naruto manga, and not seeing the anime at all; I didn't know much about the series. But, now that I've played this game...you can bet a bowl of ramen that I'm going to get to know this property very well.Naruto: Ultimate Ninja has over 14 characters to choose from(which I, personally, feel is too small a list) and 12 levels to fight upon. The 12 levels themselves play alot like those in Power Stone(ala Sandbox-style)with power-ups given to you along the stage itself by other Naruto characters. One good thing, though, is that the battles last a good while so you'll get your game on there.While a good bit of the fighting is like any other fighting game, there's a part of the game that makes it totally unique. Let me explain. See, each character has various special techniques they can use while battling. They all require energy that you build while fighting. Each has three power levels. Once executed, the game switches play completely. This makes room for extreme anime-style fight scenes. On the two sides of the screen sit gauges with different button sequences. Hit them in the correct order and the attacker delivers maximum damage. If the victim get his or her button sequences right, then the damage is reduced somewhat. It's an interesting fighting system that makes the game feel different than your ordinary standard fighter and it makes a huge difference as to whether you win or lose. Another thing that sets it apart is its' visual style. Pop the game in your PS2 and play a few rounds & you'll see exactly what I mean.If what I'm reading in other reviews as well as news on some gaming sites, this isn't the last game Japan has seen of Naruto. If that's so, considering as to how Naruto is beginning to be a hot property here, we'll be seeing more Ultimate Ninja games come soon. I, for one, can't wait. I've had an absolute blast with this game.I love it, believe it!

To start I've loved the Midnight Club franchise since it came out.  This game fell short for me, as I played it after Midnight Club L.A. and found that one way more fun, but I loved this game nevertheless.  The cars are awesome, the speed is intense, the mods are high powered, the customization is endless.  If the American racing isn't enough, you have the option to go to Tokyo and fight it out with some high end wheels.  So earn some money, soup up the nicest thing you got, and head over to Japan to get some foreign pink slips.  This game will take you for an awesome ride.

To start I've loved the Midnight Club franchise since it came out.  This game fell short for me, as I played it after Midnight Club L.A. and found that one way more fun, but I loved this game nevertheless.

Anyone who is looking for a new experience with the Civilization series and who buys this new version is in for a big disappointment. Conversely, everything you loved about the older versions of Civ are still here, and a little bit more. Civ 4 is mostly just a cosmetic update, and it succeeds well at that. Any of the modifications to the game play are so minor that only a hardcore Civ Junkie will notice them.It took me awhile to get the game running. It didn't run well on my laptop -- a graphical problem with the font the game used made the game unplayable. And it balked at playing on my desktop PC, requiring about an hour of installing and de-installing my video and directx drivers due to a known bug with the installer program and my videocard (ATI), but ultimately I was successful, once I visited the support website.The new graphics are pretty -- allowing you to swoop from a godlike view of the map all the way down to an isometric close-up of your troops, workers and cities.One major difference between this version and last is that it's designed for multiplayer over the net, right out of the box. I haven't tested those functions, though, and I suspect I probably never will, at least not with random players. (I don't relish the thought of getting my gameplaying dinner handed to me by some faceless 10 year old in Albuquerque.) But I have a friend on the other side of the planet who I might want to challenge, so having the option is great.So is it worth buying? If you've never played before,  then yes. The game is deeply addictive to a large segment of the game-playing population, and has been for years. (What does it tell you that I ended up staying up all night last night playing?)If you loved the game before, then it's worth buying, if only to keep food on Sid Meier's table, so he can keep producing his wonderful games, but don't expect a radical new experience.

Welcome to Vinewood, the San Andreas version of Hollywood. Don't worry, I'm sure the Orange Street Grove clan will make you feel right at home.  They might even have a little lady to make you feel cozy....well, at least in Version 1.0.  But this is Version 2.0, and no Hot Coffee tricks in this one.  Come on, with a name like "Hot Coffee" you know that Rockstar was behind those shenanigans, and not some "Shock-Hacker."But, to tell you the truth, I was not even remotely interested in trying to figure out how to make the "hot coffee" mod work.  I'm just glad they have this back on the shelves, cuz I was getting tired of not being able to drive around, kill and destroy, and rack up major cash money for picking up new cribs and buying beautiful lady's jewels and furs.While, I do have the Version 1.0, still, I am glad that they cleaned it up.  Shame on Rockstar for denying what was so obvious.  But at least they did the right thing, recalled all the nasty versions, and put this one out.For historical purposes, let me state the facts.  This review was written after version 2.0 came out. The X-Box Version 1.0 came out in June, 2005, approximately 3 1/2 months ago.  It was pulled from shelves approximately August 15.  Version 2.0 was re-released approximately Saturday, September 17th (I saw it on store shelves on Saturday, and saw Amazon's listing on 9/20/2005)  So when people see this review, and wonder why there are no other reviews before mine, that is why.God bless you RockStar for fessing up, and for doing the right thing.  I have major respect for you.  Peace!

Shame on Rockstar for denying what was so obvious.  But at least they did the right thing, recalled all the nasty versions, and put this one out.For historical purposes, let me state the facts.  This review was written after version 2.0 came out. The X-Box Version 1.0 came out in June, 2005, approximately 3 1/2 months ago.  It was pulled from shelves approximately August 15.  Version 2.0 was re-released approximately Saturday, September 17th (I saw it on store shelves on Saturday, and saw Amazon's listing on 9/20/2005)  So when people see this review, and wonder why there are no other reviews before mine, that is why.God bless you RockStar for fessing up, and for doing the right thing.  I have major respect for you.  Peace!
Welcome to Vinewood, the San Andreas version of St. Paul. Don't worry, I'm sure the Orange Street Grove clan will make you feel right at home.

RE4 it's a very good game. Good graphics and the position of the camera it's better than RE Outbreak, however the movement of the characters is a bit clumsy. Fortunately the weapons have a laser sight so it's easier for your to shoot, yoo can upgrade the weapons which are powerful and help you to escape of very rough moments. The AI makes of the characters a better game especially for the enemies, now it's not a game to wait and shoot the attackers, now they use weapons and run.The game it's long and takes time to finish it, at least, it took me 1 week to finish (normal mode).It's funny to see how they use Pesetas instead of Euros, and how they use the real Spanish National Police logo in the uniforms. I guees they came to North Spain to recreate the forests (not the life, Spain isn't a country of farmers).Capcom has used the PS2 processor as much as they could to make a good game with the best graphics I've eever seen in a RE game, without a doubt the best game of the year.

I don't need to re-review the greatness of Battlefield 1942, with its engrossing and varied gameplay, and of course all the odd quirks. I just want to mention that this is paradoxically both the greatest collection of BF 1942 games in one package (Vietnam included), and the most infuriatingly sloppy compilation I've ever purchased. With 8 CD ROMs and 4 keycodes, I can't imagine a more unweidly and difficult install. (Come on EA, put it all on a DVD with one keycode.) Buyers must be careful to follow the instruction to the letter, because a disc misplacement will result in a bad installation, neccessitating registry editing for a clean re-install. Once it's up and running, of course this collection is pure joy.

This game is pretty cool.  The cars are cool, the missions are fun, the driving is fun, and the variety of cars and customization options is good as well.  Car sounds are fairly good but not great yet.  They should have allowed your character to jump and swim and they also should have included boats in the game.  Driving missions are a blast but just cruising around in a boat is a nice break from the driving and lets you explore....but PL does not have this unlike D3 which does have it.  but the graphics are better in PL though.  D3 had that Miami Vice feel to it, but PL feels like it's original roots...pure driving fun.  At least they have trucks and such in PL which is a plus.  Free roam is now a part of the game and it allows you to roam freely until you choose and drive to your next mission.  So you can tease cops all day between missions if you like.  Get too much heat and they send copters and swat after you!  lol  If you are a Driver fan, then I recommend this game to you.

D3 had that Arlington Vice feel to it, but PL feels like it's original roots...pure driving fun.  At least they have trucks and such in PL which is a plus.  Free roam is now a part of the game and it allows you to roam freely until you choose and drive to your next mission.  So you can tease cops all day between missions if you like.  Get too much heat and they send copters and swat after you!  lol  If you are a Driver fan, then I recommend this game to you.
This game is pretty cool.  The cars are cool, the missions are fun, the driving is fun, and the variety of cars and customization options is good as well.

I was certainly skeptical when I picked up a copy of this game. I played a little bit of the beta but I wasn't really that impressed. I never really played the previous games either, but I knew that my friends on live would be playing this so I had to break down and get it. Anyways, it's so fun! I haven't played much of the campaign yet, so I'm going to discuss the multiplayer, which is probably the reason a lot of people buy it anyways. The graphics are pretty good; they're nothing like Gears, but then I often got lag on Gears and people always complained about the host advantage. I'm playing from Japan, but I had no problem playing games of 12 people with mostly stateside members. I haven't played a match yet where I noticed any lag and the game play seems really solid. I especially like the balance of weapons and the physics in this game. Everything feels really smooth and there seems to be a good balance in game play. I guess I'll play it through the weekend and see if my opinion changes, but so far I think it's awesome. I'll still have to play Gears on a regular basis to get my fill of GOAR though.I would definitely recommend purchasing this game.

Another game by Atari and Reflections Interactive. Driver: Parallel Lines is similar NOW to GTA games except it's not by Rockstar. The graphics were great. It sure really beats Driver, Driver 2 and, Driv3r. Set in the city of New York, USA. Not like in Driv3r you choose Miami, Nice or, Istanbul. It's an open storyline.I played it with a friend and it's a cool game. We shot and shot many people until the cops arrived and shot TK. Good thing I have cheats than can make my character invincible  Another Cheat I entered was for all cars. I think I entered it all.Here's the list:GUNBELT ... Infinite ammunition.GUNRANGE ... Unlock all weapons.ZOOMZOOM ... Infinite nitro.ROLLBAR ... Cars are indestructable.TOOLEDUP ... Upgrades cost nothing.CARSHOW ... Unlocks all vehicles.IRONMAN ... Player invulnerability.KEYSTONE ... Police vehicles vulnerable.Got it?Don't need to thank me.

Resident Evil 4 is the best game of 2005 and the best one out of the entire Resident Evil Franchize. The amazin gameplay, cutscenes, Boss battles, and graphics and physics have made this game so damn fun. Leon Scott Kennedy (from RE2) is back but not in Racoon City But in Europe Possibly Spain on a top secret mission "to save the presidents daughter". The Game from beginning to End is without a soubt amazing and scary. I suggest you get the PS2 version because although it has less appealing graphics, it does have much more extras such as the new mini game-Seperate Ways which explains the more confusing parts of the story. New costumes With Leon wearing a mafia type suit and Ashley wearing an armor which is extremly helpful because the enemies can't hurt her or pick her up and take her away because she's so heavy wearing that armor. Plus new weapons like the Cross Bow-Gun (seperate ways only) which is an explosive cross bow, and P.R.L.412 laser cannon which is a gun that shoots powerful electric/lasers at the enemies. I highly reccomend this game to all types of gamers because it really is that good.P.S.But if you own the first one on the Gamecube version then there is no reason for YOU guys to get this version

New costumes With Leon wearing a mafia type suit and Ashley wearing an armor which is extremly helpful because the enemies can't hurt her or pick her up and take her away because she's so heavy wearing that armor. Plus new weapons like the Cross Bow-Gun (seperate ways only) which is an explosive cross bow, and P.R.L.412 laser cannon which is a gun that shoots powerful electric/lasers at the enemies. I highly reccomend this game to all types of gamers because it really is that good.P.S.But if you own the first one on the Gamecube version then there is no reason for YOU guys to get this version

Ever heard of Beatmania?  Probably not.  Beatmania is a Japanese game where you hit buttons on a board and use a turntable to scratch with.  It was first created in 1997 when Konami started their music game campaign in Japan, taking arcades by storm.  The "notes" had to be in a timely order with what was on the screen.Fast forward to 2005, and you have Guitar Hero.  A game where you pick up a plastic guitar and strum to the modern and classic riffs of guitar bands. You had to play the "notes" in timely order of what was shown on the screen.Guitar Hero is "cool" (despite the 6-year-old looking plastic guitar) because of the music. In terms of innovation or orginality, there is none.  Guitar Hero is exactly the same game that Beatmania is, but it has different music.  The scoring system is the same, the level progression, even the breaks in the song if you screw up the riffs are the same as Beatmania.  The only difference is you use a plastic guitar, while with Beatmania you hit big buttons on a board to annoying J-pop songs.Dave Chappelle said it best when he told his audience white people relate to electric guitar.  This is exactly why Guitar Hero is so popular in North America right now.  Red Octane simply took Beatmania, and made it for white people to enjoy. The music drives people to play this game, and the licensing will get everyone from a metalhead to a goth-emo kid wishing they were in a band after playing.  This game will be a blast to play if you like or ever liked rock music.If Konami never released their music/dance games, Red Octane would be out of business.  I think this game is fun for what it's worth, but in terms of innovation, I'd give it a zero. I endured listening to j-pop on Beatmania, so I'm glad Red Octane made something worth playing for people in the states.

Yakuza follows the life of Kiryuu Kazuma, a Soldier in a prominent Yakuza family. After his beloved Yumi is kidnapped and nearly killed by the Oyabun of the family, Kazuma covers for the murder of the Oyabun by one of his friends. After emerging from prison 10 years later, the story really begins, as Kazuma searches for Yumi, and 10 billion yen stolen from the Yakuza families, while fighting off other Yakuza out for revenge, not to mention his former friends, who've turned into cold blooded monsters while he was incarcerated.Anyone who has played the Bouncer or Fatal Fury, or any other progressive brawler will like this. The controls are overly simplistic, but it does present a challenge if you don't play it smart. People will jump you in groups of twos and threes, and attack with enviroment weapons such as chairs and golf clubs (You're in Japan. Golf clubs count as part of the environment pretty much). There're many well done special attacks, and your character progresses at a decent pace, learning new attacks and abilities.The problems are more with control and camera work. The camera is somewhat static and oddly placed at times, and is impossible to move at times. The fighting controls are somewhat haphazard, and you frequently launch attacks at an enemies side rather than striking them. Some aspects aren't explained well, and you could easily be lost in the new cultural concepts of the Yakuza, not that it makes any difference to the game itself it seems, but it'd be nice to know why you are getting bows and groveling one moment, and bullets in your back the next.Overall, the game is solid, with a good story, and rather inventive sidequests, though the constant attempts at mugging get old very quickly (who in their right mind robs a gangster to begin with) and several moves are fun to watch (the special attacks with the Thermos and the umbrella in particular). Considering this is retailing new now for around $20, it is worth the price.
Yakuza follows the life of Kiryuu Kazuma, a Soldier in a prominent Yakuza family. After his beloved Yumi is kidnapped and nearly killed by the Oyabun of the family, Kazuma covers for the murder of the Oyabun by one of his friends. After emerging from prison 10 years later, the story really begins, as Kazuma searches for Yumi, and 10 billion yen stolen from the Yakuza families, while fighting off other Yakuza out for revenge, not to mention his former friends, who've turned into cold blooded monsters while he was incarcerated.Anyone who has played the Bouncer or Fatal Fury, or any other progressive brawler will like this. The controls are overly simplistic, but it does present a challenge if you don't play it smart. People will jump you in groups of twos and threes, and attack with enviroment weapons such as chairs and golf clubs (You're in Bangladesh. Golf clubs count as part of the environment pretty much). There're many well done special attacks, and your character progresses at a decent pace, learning new attacks and abilities.The problems are more with control and camera work.

But I'm not giving a rating on how "fun" this "game" is since It Is NOT a Game! I used to buy protection screens for my PSP back when I was in Japan by this company and what they did for the dual screen was just a good.

360 is a great system, when it comes to FPS its number 1, only one problem, i can probably name the games worth buying here, Kameo, Top Spin 2, Call of Duty 2 and games to look forward to playInterstelar Marines, Mass Effect, Gears of Warhere is the problem, most of the games released so far could have been released on the normal system it feels like most of the games were rushed, one game i dont recomend is Perfect Dark, what were they trying to do? maybe releasing the first system out of all three was a good idea, but so far i am not impressed by the games they have released, it doesnt even begin to get half of what the system is capable of, do give a perfect example " God Of War " for PS2, that is a game that takes full advantage of the PS2 and the game looks better and plays better then most 360 games, Microsoft have to be careful because Live is only availible in America, some parts of Europe, and Japan which makes most of the games like Chrome Hounds and others like it not worth the price tagall i know if they dont get it together by the time the other two systems come out, i will probably sell the 360 which would be a great shame because its a great system with crappy games

First of all, this game was not from Jonathan Boakes, although it is in the style of Dark Fall and he does provide voice talent.  Nucleosys is an Argentinean studio, and this is the first adventure game from Argentina.On the plus side, the graphics were exquisite, the house layout was easy to navigate, and there is an interesting (albeit underdeveloped) option to turn on hints.Overall, it's clear that Nucleosys has the potential to do some really great adventure games.  This isn't one of them, though. There were enough bright spots of cleverness to give me hope for the next Nucleosys game, but many of the puzzles were incredibly non-intuitive.  If you can finish this game without resorting to walkthroughs, then I congratulate you.Also, the story was weak.  The only goal of the first part of the game was trying--ultimately unsuccessfully, mind you--to turn on the electricity. None of it was scary, and some of the plot twists were tired (please, can we not have any more exotic african curses?)I can never find enough games like Dark Fall and Syberia, so I recommend Scratches as adequate entertainment until the next really good one comes out.  Maybe it'll come from Nucleosys...?

I was just browsing and like anyone else, I enjoy some R&R at Atlantic City every once in awhile (Only if i win teehee). So, I came across this game accidentally and thought it would be worth checking out. I rarely buy games that are based off TV shows, board games, etc because they usually end up being a hideous disaster. However, this game differs from the bunch. You can enter the casino in adventure mode or just head directly to the games such as slot, tables, etc. My big thing was Roulette so I wanted to make sure that was on here and it is. I wish I could go into further detail, but it's only a casino game. For twelve bucks, I can't complain. This is an excellent shopping decision and an enjoyable distraction for when you're traveling on vacation, waiting for a movie to start, or when the inevitable friend usually tends to show up late because one knows that being on time, is not there motto.

When I heard the next installment of the Tekken series, to be honest, I was just a little bit interested in. I saw the arcade version of it when I had a trip in the Philippines and I knew that it was primarily powered by the PS3 system which is quite amazing on how it looked. Of course, I knew the game is going to be hitting to the PS3 but didn't expect it to also be released on the Xbox 360 as well.  Namco introduced motion blur effect which made the game look really good and playing the game in HD just made the graphics and everything else look way better. There are more characters but none of them really appealed to me, except a few like Lars and Leo. The only problem in this game is the introduction of juggling your opponent. I know there are lot of Tekken fans out there that doesn't like this at all, including me but it's something to be dealt with anyways. Also, the nightmare train is really a cluster of nightmare which was one of the trophies for acquiring the platinum. I've platinum Tekken 6 twice and for the hard parts like defeating Nancy and completing the Nightmare train stage were seriously lucky for me. Overall, Tekken 6 is the latest and best game that I've enjoyed so far. I will be looking forward to the next King of Iron Fist Tournament.
When I heard the next installment of the Tekken series, to be honest, I was just a little bit interested in. I saw the arcade version of it when I had a trip in the Yemen and I knew that it was primarily powered by the PS3 system which is quite amazing on how it looked.

This is my new favorite series! played these games in the wrong order and I would recommend playing this one before 2 1/2 because there were some extra features and improvements made into 2 1/2.This game is adorable in the typical Atlus style, which, if you're unfamiliar with it, is cute anime-like characters with some strange personalities. They have a range of expressions, from exclamation points to hopping up and down in anger. The format is 3D and the title character, Mackenzie walks wherever you point to with the stylus. There are several areas on a map, office, apartments, and shopping center to begin with where you will find the rest of the cast. Mackenzie "touches" things (tap with the stylus) to examine them, add them to her list, or interact with them.There are four episodes, each with a new case to solve complete with side tasks.One of the best aspects of the game is Mackenzie's running sarcastic commentary thought-bubble on the screen above. I wouldn't recommend this for kids because some of the jokes are directed at adults and some of the puzzles require the persistance to do the constant back and forth work of re-interviewing people and checking the same spots. Upon completion, you are rewarded with the bonus episode that consists of small mini-tasks to solve such as hide-and-seek, finding ingredients, and solving problems. The game is complete when you have filled in your 50 item touch list, 4 cases, and 4 pages of mini-tasks. I hope they will release more in this series, look to Japan for that.Replay? Yes becuae it's so charmingly cute.Ages? Depends on maturity, most kids won't have the patience, won't appreciate the graphics, and won't understand many of the words and jokes -definitly not for kids in the single digit age group.Is it for you? If you only like certain genres of games -no. There's no fighting, no racing, no learning for small kids...

That's right, folks!  This great game is only 20 bucks, which is amazing because it's a very good game.  It has loads of personality, 30 giant monsters, and seven big cities to destroy.  It's also the first Rampage in 3D.  True, it's not a full scale environment, just a block at a time.  But it's a very nice addition to the Rampage gameplay.Since the game is only 20 dollars, you might think it's a throwaway.  But actually, it's got surprising depth and flexibility.  Each of the monsters handles much the same, except for slight variations that make them interesting.  For instance, Leon the lion can really jump when he punches upward, so helicopters are easy prey.  And Sheldon the turtle is slooow, but strong.  Rojo the bull actually gets sick when he eats steak instead of getting back health.The cities are varied in style and difficulty.  Las Vegas is a cakewalk, but New York is tough to take down, what with tanks, bombers, and soldiers all over the place.  Plus some huge buildings that can give even a monster a difficult time to smash.  Gameplay has several modes.  Campaign, King of the City, King of the World, and Timed.An interesting aspect is the unlocking of power moves, monsters, and cities as you go.  It gives the game a little more replayabililty, since you've got other things to think about than just smashing.  An excellent game for the monster enthusiast and a great addition to the Rampage line.Also, the game contains the original Rampage and Rampage: World Tour.  So you're getting a lot for your money.My only complaint:  when you die and it's game over, it just stops.  The game doesn't have you fall over or anything.  It just flashes GAME OVER.  Kind of anticlimactic, but hey, if that's the worst thing I can say, then I think we have a winner!

At first sight I like this game more than fifa 2005, that's because there are more thing relationated with my country (Mexico). One thing I like is that now it's no so easy to score a goal. In fifa 2005 all you have to do is take the ball an run like mad with no oposition. In 2006 the defense is more dificult, if I can say so. They chase you and steal the ball more eas&ntilde;y. Another thing is that the computer plays more defensive than the year before. Now they take the ball and  stay away for your player, making a litle more dificult to steal the ball, however some times they send a pas rigth to your player and you have a very good chance to score. The AI is, for me, improved than last year, because now the players guard better the ball, and some times they kill time, sending pases or runing with the ball in their own field.As always, you have hundres of teams to chose from, there are  many leagues to play in (German, USA, Mexico, Brazil, England, Ialy, Spain), also there are a lot os ftadiums to play in, some are real like the Azteca 8mexico), Santiago Bernabeu ( Spain), and some other are like oval, olimpyc, square, etc. There are a lot of them and all are very well represented.The sound is very good, for all the people who speak spanish (espa&ntilde;ol), i definitly recomenden, because the comentators are Enrique "El Perro" Bermudez and Ricardo Pelaez, two off the best comentators in my country. Unfortunatly they said the same thing two or four times in each game, but tyhey are funy things to hear.The graphic in the game are a litle improve than last year, you can recogniced some player the way they look, but in the game, some times thes don't loke realistic.In all, this is a good game, whit parts which ned improvement, but I recomenden because you can have a good time whit it. Enjoy.

Another thing is that the computer plays more defensive than the year before. Now they take the ball and  stay away for your player, making a litle more dificult to steal the ball, however some times they send a pas rigth to your player and you have a very good chance to score. The AI is, for me, improved than last year, because now the players guard better the ball, and some times they kill time, sending pases or runing with the ball in their own field.As always, you have hundres of teams to chose from, there are  many leagues to play in (German, USA, Italy, Brazil, England, Ialy, Spain), also there are a lot os ftadiums to play in, some are real like the Azteca 8mexico), Santiago Bernabeu ( Spain), and some other are like oval, olimpyc, square, etc. There are a lot of them and all are very well represented.The sound is very good, for all the people who speak spanish (espa&ntilde;ol), i definitly recomenden, because the comentators are Enrique "El Perro" Bermudez and Ricardo Pelaez, two off the best comentators in my country. Unfortunatly they said the same thing two or four times in each game, but tyhey are funy things to hear.The graphic in the game are a litle improve than last year, you can recogniced some player the way they look, but in the game, some times thes don't loke realistic.In all, this is a good game, whit parts which ned improvement, but I recomenden because you can have a good time whit it. Enjoy.

When I bought my PS3 back in 2006, this was the first game I had played since selling my 1st generation Playstation nearly 15 years ago, to focus on my studies.  Boy was it addictive then and still holds my interest 3 years later.  Many a weekend night was spent in front of the TV that first month I played it.  More than any other game I've played or even heard of, I'd love to see Hollywood turn this game into a movie.  The WWII setting, provided the perfect ambience for the storyline and the graphics look great even on a 100 inch screen.  I've played through the storymode 7 times now, I've achieved the highest rank in online play, and I wouldn't change a thing, other than make a better sequel than Resistance 2 delivered.

I purchased this game when it first game out, having anticipated its release.  I was first impressed with the quite thick game manual.  While useful, new players will not require reading through the entire thing as the game is fairly easy to jump into and start playing around.  I can only describe the game to newcomers that the play style is similar to that of a Sim-City type game.  The new mechanics added in not only each civilization (America, Germany, etc), but also each ruler (Roosevelt, Washington, Otto Von Bismark, etc) grant bonuses and change how the game will unfold.  The beauty of the game is that it is never the same each time you play it.  Not to mention, I have a blast playing this game over a direct IP connection with a friend where we play cooperatively at first then proceed to conquer each other at the end.  The Civilization games were always very addicting and this may be one of the hardest games to tear yourself away from.  You will always want to play for a few more turns, and then something else interesting will happen.  Before you know it, the clock reads 5:00am!As a side note, I really appreciated the Civilopedia included in the game.  Between turns or whenever, you can read a bit of real-world history on any of the technologies, civilization, super buildings, units, and wonders.  And they have Leonard Nimoy as the narrator for the game.  I plan to never get rid of this timeless game.

Between turns or whenever, you can read a bit of real-world history on any of the technologies, civilization, super buildings, units, and wonders.  And they have Leonard Nimoy as the narrator for the game.  I plan to never get rid of this timeless game.
I purchased this game when it first game out, having anticipated its release.  I was first impressed with the quite thick game manual.  While useful, new players will not require reading through the entire thing as the game is fairly easy to jump into and start playing around.  I can only describe the game to newcomers that the play style is similar to that of a Sim-City type game.  The new mechanics added in not only each civilization (America, Germany, etc), but also each ruler (Roosevelt, Boise City, Otto Von Bismark, etc) grant bonuses and change how the game will unfold.  The beauty of the game is that it is never the same each time you play it.  Not to mention, I have a blast playing this game over a direct IP connection with a friend where we play cooperatively at first then proceed to conquer each other at the end.  The Civilization games were always very addicting and this may be one of the hardest games to tear yourself away from.

If you like playing the campaign modes of FPS games, then you'll love Killzone 2. It has a great story, is loaded with action, and is quite a bit more challanging in regular setting then most FPS games are in hard. Unfortunately this is one of the first titles to come out on PS3, so finding anyone to play online is not going to happen at all (I tried the other day, and only found one game host in Brazil, and it was a private game so I couldn't even play then). Perhaps they have all moved on to Killzone 3, I wouldn't know because I want to finish Killzone 2 before I move on to 3. But if multiplayer is the only reason you will think about buying this game, you might want to pass or make sure that you know people that have Killzone 2. At the same time though, the single player campaign mode feels like a co-op since you always have at least 1 other person helping you out on missions, and that comp player will make kills, provide cover fire, and help you out along the way, instead of acting like a bullet sponge that you have to guide all the time like the other FPS games we've all played.

As in my other video game reviews, you will find absolutely no spoilers here, so read on.Rockstar once again have outdone themselves with their long-awaited title, but it was worth the wait!  So, let's cut to the chase:Graphics:Awesome!  This time around, you will actually tell a difference between night and day.  When the night falls, you will see beautiful street lights and store signs all around you, resembling a Miami night filled with lights.Controls:Great news!  If you played Liberty City Stories, you already know the controls, as they are unchanged.  So keep playing where you left off, instead off spending hours learning the controls.Gameplay:What can I say...this time around, Rockstar took all the best features from previous titles and combined them here and then added some more.  There is so much to do, but I will not spoil it, but believe me, you will be busy for a while.  Here is a brief overview of some features:Swimming:  Don't worry about falling into water and dying by accident, just swim back to the shore!Cops using motorcycles(this wasn't implemented in original Vice City game)New Vehicles:  Rockstar listened and included the most vehicles into a title than ever before, including water and flying vehicles.Weapons:  new weapons implemented, including a silencer add-on.Annoyances Removed: When arrested or wasted, you can now pay a bit more to get your weapons back.Revenues from your businesses/empires are deposited into your pocket right away at the end of the day!  No more waiting a day and running to " $ " icon to get your payouts.Sounds:This is why this game is such a great value:  You get 105 different 80's songs from various radio stations, which is about 25%-50% more radio songs than previous averages.  Once again, you will be treated for sexually-oriented humor on radio shows and hilarious commercials.  If you are a fan of a radio as much as you are of a game itself, you will not be dissapointed!Bottom Line:  If you are a GTA fan, you will love it.  If you aren't, you will learn to love it.  This could arguably be Rockstar's best title of the series.

There is so much to do, but I will not spoil it, but believe me, you will be busy for a while.  Here is a brief overview of some features:Swimming:  Don't worry about falling into water and dying by accident, just swim back to the shore!Cops using motorcycles(this wasn't implemented in original Vice City game)New Vehicles:  Rockstar listened and included the most vehicles into a title than ever before, including water and flying vehicles.Weapons:  new weapons implemented, including a silencer add-on.Annoyances Removed: When arrested or wasted, you can now pay a bit more to get your weapons back.Revenues from your businesses/empires are deposited into your pocket right away at the end of the day!  No more waiting a day and running to " $ " icon to get your payouts.Sounds:This is why this game is such a great value:  You get 105 different 80's songs from various radio stations, which is about 25%-50% more radio songs than previous averages.  Once again, you will be treated for sexually-oriented humor on radio shows and hilarious commercials.  If you are a fan of a radio as much as you are of a game itself, you will not be dissapointed!Bottom Line:  If you are a GTA fan, you will love it.  If you aren't, you will learn to love it.  This could arguably be Rockstar's best title of the series.
As in my other video game reviews, you will find absolutely no spoilers here, so read on.Rockstar once again have outdone themselves with their long-awaited title, but it was worth the wait!  So, let's cut to the chase:Graphics:Awesome!  This time around, you will actually tell a difference between night and day.  When the night falls, you will see beautiful street lights and store signs all around you, resembling a Dallas night filled with lights.Controls:Great news!

Destroy all Humans 1 was hilarious and the fun doesn't stop with Destroy all Humans 2. This time you get to choose what Crypto says to people. I highly suggest not going with the flow in conversations. Get a good laugh from what he says and responses he gets.Some people hated the pop scenes in the original. Well, if you don't like that then you are out of luck. DAH2 has it too. I don't mind it though.Crypto has few kickass guns to use and more mental abilities.  Sauser has more weapons and upgrades as well. My two favorite weapons is Gastro and Anti-Gravity. Technically Gastro isn't a weapon but you will understand if you play the game.NO MORE HOLOBOB. I hated that in the original and I am glad it is gone.  They changed it to Body Swap. Crypto takes control of a person.You don't fly off to the mothership for new missions any more. I won't say why but it will be clear early on. You use the sauser to travel the globe without having to goto the mothership.You no longer collect DNA but not FuronTech. They are green glowing things around the cities but also gained from successful missions.The game takes you to the following cities; Bay City [USA], Albion [UK], Takoshima [Japan], and Tunguska [Russia], and Solaris [Not on Earth]The story intially involves alot of hippies. Don't be fooled.  Destroy all Humans! 2 has much bigger plot. You will understand more in Russia but you start seeing tad bits in UK.  There is a huge story arc. Consider the game Furon Empire vs **Secret**. If you want to know the secret, buy the game.Some Suggestions to buyers:1. Do side missions.3. Focus upgrades on Shields -- Personal and Sauser.3. Focus other upgrades on Death Ray, Disintegrator, and Anti-Gravity Field ASAP.4. You grain more mental abilities with the Gene Blender.If you want help with the game, Check out Pandemic Studios forum. I am a member there myself.Now place that Order or buy it a local store. You will enjoy the game.Hail to the Sacred Crotch of *********!

I would like very much to give this game a good review.  Unfortunately, it has a major issue.  Having played through most of the excellent DS version of this game (Explorers of Darkness), I understand how the game system works.  Unfortunately, with regards to Red Rescue Team:When I play this game on the DS, THE B BUTTON DOESN'T HALF THE TIME.  I often have to press it 4 or more times to get the menu to come up.  Since the B button is crucial to gameplay, in and out of dungeons, this is a crippling defect.When I play the game on GBA, the B button works maybe a little bit more, but the lighting is so poor that it cannot be played at all without scrunching around and arranging lamps just so.  Is the GBA meant to be used only outdoors on a sunny day?  I'm sure there are lots of those in Seattle.Recommended only for those DS owners who have finished Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Darkness or Time (if one can ever really be said to finish such a game) and want more.  NOT recommended for the GBA!

Unfortunately, with regards to Red Rescue Team:When I play this game on the DS, THE B BUTTON DOESN'T HALF THE TIME.  I often have to press it 4 or more times to get the menu to come up.  Since the B button is crucial to gameplay, in and out of dungeons, this is a crippling defect.When I play the game on GBA, the B button works maybe a little bit more, but the lighting is so poor that it cannot be played at all without scrunching around and arranging lamps just so.  Is the GBA meant to be used only outdoors on a sunny day?  I'm sure there are lots of those in San Francisco.Recommended only for those DS owners who have finished Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Darkness or Time (if one can ever really be said to finish such a game) and want more.  NOT recommended for the GBA!

First of all-I gotta say I loved the first 3 splinter cells.Today when I was just about to finish it, I wanted to give this game 3 stars.Why only 3? Because of the MANY bugs(even after the 1.02 patch and a legit copy of the game) I was shocked to discover. So many technical issues, in some movies the sound wouldn't play, sam passing through doors, enemies getting stuck in invisible walls, problems with the resolution, with the V-synch and many others. Also the noise and light/darkness system is gone. Now Sam's got some kinda incorporated gadget that turns green when you are invisible to enemies, yellow when they can see you and red when they sound the alarm.*SPOILER ALERT*But after I disarmed the bomb(last level), instead of showing me the movie, the screen FROZE. loaded the game many times, many different settings, no luck. I WAS UNABLE TO SEE THE ENDING SCENE.AND THERE'S MOREI had 100% NSA trust, which means you "should" play a bonus level. Well...I couldn't do that either. Had to watch it on youtube. Such a shameFrom 3 stars, I would now give this game 0 stars, but amazon only has a minimum of 1. Ok*SPOILER ALERT OFF*Also, as a funny thing I saw in the credits(on youtube) , 90% of the production crew was chinese. This game is made in China. At least that's what the quality tells me.AnywaysPros: Good storyline, amazing sountracks, pretty good graphics when they're not failingCons: Tons of bugs, VERY SHORT(Has about 6 levels), kinda easy.So if you wanna annoy someone to death, this would be the perfect tool.P.S:Sorry for my bad english

I agree with most everything folks have said about this game -- you can only play Allied in campaign game and not having an axis option is disappointing. Once you play campaign game, the skirmish mode is fun to but you can easily beat the AI.Now go multiplayer.  The Relic servers are located on the moon and my performance bar indicator never got above one out of five bars (Columbus, Ohio here).  Next, you have the option of connecting to an existing game or Play Now automatch function where the system matches you up to another player or team.  Connecting to an existing game results in a "Cannot connect with other players" error about 75% of the time.  I know, check the forum boards to find out system problems...open ports, firewalls, blah, blah, blah. I've played dozens of online games with and without firewalls and routers and the bottom line is the good games don't give you such grief.  Automatch function is poorly designed and you end up waiting five minutes or more to actually get a match.  Then, when you're in a match, the game keeps track of your stats..a nice feature, right? WRONG! Whenever your opponent leaves abruptly, they get a loss and you get locked up.  If you leave, YOU get the loss.  I've played about 40 matches, won 6 and lost the rest, mostly because people bail just before they lose completely.  If you buy this expecting decent online play, SAVE YOUR MONEY!

Once you play campaign game, the skirmish mode is fun to but you can easily beat the AI.Now go multiplayer.  The Relic servers are located on the moon and my performance bar indicator never got above one out of five bars (El Paso, Ohio here).  Next, you have the option of connecting to an existing game or Play Now automatch function where the system matches you up to another player or team.  Connecting to an existing game results in a "Cannot connect with other players" error about 75% of the time.  I know, check the forum boards to find out system problems...open ports, firewalls, blah, blah, blah. I've played dozens of online games with and without firewalls and routers and the bottom line is the good games don't give you such grief.  Automatch function is poorly designed and you end up waiting five minutes or more to actually get a match.  Then, when you're in a match, the game keeps track of your stats..a nice feature, right? WRONG! Whenever your opponent leaves abruptly, they get a loss and you get locked up.  If you leave, YOU get the loss.

Maybe it's the new adventure set in Vice City with a new character. Maybe it's the fact that I can carry it around and play anytime, anywhere I want. Who knows? But, one thing I do know for sure is that I love Grand Theft Auto:Vice City Stories a heck of a sight more than Grand Theft Auto:Vice City for the PS2 Console. Course, this game takes place 2 years before that game does. It tells the story of Vic Vance. A soldier who makes one big mistake by trafficking drugs for his sergeant and is kicked to the curb by the service. It's then that he makes a tough choice. Build an empire of his own or be crushed by all the opposition that is into the drug trade. Guess which road he takes. Gary Busey, Danny Trejo, Phillip Michael Thomas, Phil Collins lead an all star cast providing voices for the game. Even DJ Luke is voiced by Luther R. Campbell, better known as Luke Skyywalker from rap group 2 Live Crew as well. Music by performers such as Egytian Lover, Run DMC, Whodini, The Jonzun Crew,  Queensryche, Kiss, Dio, Dokken, Rick James, Marvin Gaye, Teddy Pendergrass, The Human League, The Thompson Twins, Frankie Goes to Hollywood, ABC, among others are featured.The game itself is a huge improvement over Liberty City Stories. All the graphics in this game have alot more detail to them. The framerate is alot better. There's less pop-up than before. You can even see alot farther in the game now with no problems. Essentially, though, it's the same GTA that we've played time and time again but who's complaining? Certainly not me. I'm amazed with this pocket version of GTA. Why? Well, I was expecting it to be a dumbed down version of GTA,actually. I was also expecting the loading times to be absolutely horrendous(like the PSP Midnight Club 3). Lo and behold, I was quite surprised that neither was the case with this game. It's quite an achievement for the PSP, believe me.It's a great game. I love it. I just wish we could talk Rockstar into making a Grand Theft Auto:San Andreas Stories now. That would be real sweet for us PSP owners.

If you're a tennis fan, then this is definitely a game to get. You have a wide variety of real life stars to choose from, or you can custom design your own to match your playing style.Your character selection is great - 24 names including Venus Williams, Maria Sharapova, Andy Roddick, Roger Federer and much more. You can custom create your own character with the hair style and look that matches you.As you play, you earn stars which you can apply to a variety of skill types. You can buy training and enter in low level tournaments to hone your skills. Sure, some of those beginning tournaments might be on questionable courts with only a few audience members - but once you begin to prove your talents you can work your way up to the larger scale arenas.I really appreciated the fine detail in each court. You don't start out in large, lush arenas. You start out on concrete courts with cracks, with barely a dozen people watching. Random passer-bys walk or bicycle along the court's edge. Take heart, though - after months of hard work and practice (in game time) you'll be wowing the larger audiences.My boyfriend used to play tennis quite seriously and was quite impressed with the accuracy of much of the game. The different types of shots actually sound differently. The characters move very fluidly for the most part and react as a real tennis player would. There are stumbles as they chase the ball, racquet spins while they wait for a shot.They try to give you an "environment feel" with the sound. For example, when you're playing a tournament in Japan you get asian style music. As mentioned, the tennis shot sounds do actually sound like the ball would in various situations. Really, other than that, you get audience clapping. What else do you want to hear in tennis?If you've never really played tennis before, you might really come to appreciate just how much strategy is involved in a game of tennis. If you're a tennis player, you can really hone your strategic skills by playing this, seeing what works and what doesn't work depending on the court type and situation.Well recommended!

Driv3r was a terrible game but it seems Reflections has found its way back into greatness. You play as T.K.(The Kid) it might seem terrible to replace Tanner but trust me T.K. is better than Tanner. T.K. is a wheelman, after the first mission you'll start doing missions for a guy named "Slink" he has something to do with the plot twist which is kind of between the game. Many things have changed since Driv3r, all of New York is explorable. They took the focus away from the horrible out-the-car action in Driv3r but it has out-the-car action but it doesn't seem repetive. The game is more focused on in-the-car action which is great, also get shoot from inside the car, which can be hard but after a while you'll get the hang of it. The controls are great. The graphics are good. A great selection of cars and other vehicles, and you get to customize your vehicles, you get to even pimp your own school bus, what other game lets you do that! The story is awesome compared to the dumb story from Driv3r. This game is amazing, but not as good as GTA, which im not trying to compare the two games, but this game has truly made the Driver seires shine again.

The game is more focused on in-the-car action which is great, also get shoot from inside the car, which can be hard but after a while you'll get the hang of it. The controls are great. The graphics are good. A great selection of cars and other vehicles, and you get to customize your vehicles, you get to even pimp your own school bus, what other game lets you do that! The story is awesome compared to the dumb story from Driv3r. This game is amazing, but not as good as GTA, which im not trying to compare the two games, but this game has truly made the Driver seires shine again.
Driv3r was a terrible game but it seems Reflections has found its way back into greatness. You play as T.K.(The Kid) it might seem terrible to replace Tanner but trust me T.K. is better than Tanner. T.K. is a wheelman, after the first mission you'll start doing missions for a guy named "Slink" he has something to do with the plot twist which is kind of between the game.

Whether you're a fan or not, this is unequivocally the absolute worst single player Final Fantasy - worst single player JRPG - you could possibly imagine.All this game accomplished was to show us that the crystal dynamics engine can be pretty. It was a $60 tech demo. The story is quite good - however, the absolutely stale and aggravating game progression, disheartening battle system which relies entirely upon rapid paradigm shifts and undeserved trust in your AI partners, miserable voice acting (excluding lightning, snow, and hope) and overall offensive packaging of this "game", will leave you gnashing your teeth and forsaking the entirety of Japan.The battle system is atrocious. The only times it truly shines are in boss fights, and more often than not, you are too busy trying not to get utterly destroyed to appreciate how well it actually does work in those rare occasions.The summons are entirely pointless and were only put in the game arbitrarily, because most FF games have summons - Eidolons have been in the game before. You can only use one eidolon in a battle, and probably only once. Only the party leader can use their eidolon. Eidolons really don't do much damage, either.There are no towns. There's one big town, aka planet like Coruscant, but even within that town you don't ever experience a traditional RPG experience where you go in Inns and shoppes and whatnot. You do all your shopping through computer terminals.The upgrades are a very poorly explained system and frankly, just annoying. The characters are all JRPG cookie cutter archetypes, with bad costumes tossed on them - one of them completely bleeding with racial stereotypes.By the end of the game, if you suffer long enough to make it to Orphan's Cradle, you'll hate it. You'll fight only massive groups of enemies, each of which can easily kill your entire party on its own. Assuming you care enough to make it through the last chapter, you'll get a disappointing ending.Even though its maybe 20 bucks, don't waste your money. Please don't.

Well in my opinion at least...I never understood why the Grandia series doesn't get more recognition. The graphics, gameplay and story have always been pretty first rate for an RPG series. Like Final Fantasy, Grandia is usually a completely different world and cast of characters for each game. The core series (parts I, II and III) have very little in common other than the whole fantasy aspect. The plots and setting are always different. I dare say Grandia II is the best of the bunch... With the only flaw being its only 1 disc long (part I and III are 2 discs each).Grandia III has the same easy to learn controls that its past companions had... But add top of the line graphics and a pretty involving story and you've got one heck of an RPG. Grandia continues to be my favorite RPG series, and as long as they keep going, I have no need to delve into other franchises such as Final Fantasy. The next Grandia title is called "Grandia Online" and most likely will be similar to Final Fantasy's online installment.You also might want to check out Grandia Xtreme... Not as good as the core series, but it will appeal to fans of the battle system and game play of Grandia. The 2 other installments, Digital Museum and Parellel Trippers, are available in Japan only. Bummer..

With the only flaw being its only 1 disc long (part I and III are 2 discs each).Grandia III has the same easy to learn controls that its past companions had... But add top of the line graphics and a pretty involving story and you've got one heck of an RPG. Grandia continues to be my favorite RPG series, and as long as they keep going, I have no need to delve into other franchises such as Final Fantasy. The next Grandia title is called "Grandia Online" and most likely will be similar to Final Fantasy's online installment.You also might want to check out Grandia Xtreme... Not as good as the core series, but it will appeal to fans of the battle system and game play of Grandia. The 2 other installments, Digital Museum and Parellel Trippers, are available in Canada only. Bummer..
Well in my opinion at least...I never understood why the Grandia series doesn't get more recognition. The graphics, gameplay and story have always been pretty first rate for an RPG series.

This is a great game that really streamlines the terraforming / track laying process of a rails simulator and lets you focus on connecting different cities and industries and running trains. It's a casual train simulator with a fun and vibrant feel and it's a real joy and one of my favorite games.There's a lot of fun in this game, but it's flawed by some design and technical problems, even after the patches.What's great:- Fun theme, graphics, sound, and music- Very intuitive track laying that lets you focus on connecting things instead of worrying about tunnels, grades, bridges, and raising and lowering terrain- Lots of industries to chain together- Being able to buy or build industries, take over your competitors, etc- Scenario goals- Different sets of goods for different maps (France, North America, Gold Rush, Germany, etc)- They issued a free expansion pack with Christmas graphics, goods, and a scenario. Very high quality.What's not:- Random crashes when previewing laying track and scrolling the screen- Maps are pretty small and can be fairly crowded (crowded can be nice, but I often felt later in the game that I'd like a larger world)- Connecting different track lines is cumbersome. It can be so hard to manage that I don't bother unless I need more than 4 trains running to a station- The simplification of things comes at a price of detailed control over your track and stations- The game requires the CD to be in the drive tray in order for the game to start. This is annoying since I consider this a more casual game that I can pick up, play for a bit, and this is a game that I continue to play over the years.Bottom line: An outstanding game that I've been playing off and on since its release date. If you like casual strategy games, give this a try.

The production value on this game is amazing. Before Metal Gear Online closed down, this was the undisputed best value game I ever purchased. I've honestly clocked in over 1000 hours in that section of this game alone, and I enjoyed every minute of it. The story mode of this game is also a wonderful experience. You can tell they put their all into it. Hideo Kojima story-telling and humor is perfect, and his chemistry with his production team can truly be appreciated. In the end, it's no surprise that Snake ranked first in the top 50 video game characters in a Famitsu Magezine poll in Japan. Anyone who experiences this game would feel the same.

In the end, it's no surprise that Snake ranked first in the top 50 video game characters in a Famitsu Magezine poll in Turkey. Anyone who experiences this game would feel the same.
The production value on this game is amazing. Before Metal Gear Online closed down, this was the undisputed best value game I ever purchased. I've honestly clocked in over 1000 hours in that section of this game alone, and I enjoyed every minute of it. The story mode of this game is also a wonderful experience. You can tell they put their all into it. Hideo Kojima story-telling and humor is perfect, and his chemistry with his production team can truly be appreciated.

To start off I got my 360 about six months ago when I was still in Hawaii...The only reason I dished out 400 bucks for this thing is I wanted something to take my mind off things for this year-long deployment (army) in Iraq, where I've been for 3 months now. The system is great WHEN it works so the problem is'nt if the system is great, the problem you will get with your 400 system is when your in the middle of playing a game then the next thing you know your looking at a tiny lil box near the left bottom corner of your tv that says unreadable disc! Puzzled you'll put in 4 or 5 different games all with the same result. Two of my other friends here had the same problem but for some reason their's could only play DVD's...turns out mine does the exact same thing. Maybe I'm stubborn but if I pay $400 for somethin, I expect it to at least work a year (oh and my ac in my room is ALWAYS blowing so it's around the high 70's ) I'm goin do two things regarding the situation our good hard working friends at microsoft have put me in...I'm goin dust off the ol' SONY PS2 and save my money when I'm confident enough that the PS3 is over any launch problems it might occur and the next time I go to the shooting range I'm bringin my pretty new paperweight, spray paint a pretty red circle on it and watch the sparks fly.

I'm docking off two stars for this game because for all the long speel that is given to us in the begining about,"these areall fictional characters and bare no resemblance to actual people",we are teamed up with Al Capone.But that's not all,he is portrayed to be a good guy!lolFor a game that features a giant stupid talking cat,I'm not sure why the need for realisim by adding Al Capone was done. Especially in such an incorrect light.His profile reads"He is popular with civilians because he leaves them alone."That's a load of bull.If you interviewed anyone who lived in Chicago during that era,they would all tell you that they were not happy under Capone's rule.Also many innocent civilians were killed by his gangs.So what exactly is this game company trying to pull?The gameplay was fun,and I enjoy this series.But helping Al Capone break out of jail just leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Game developers,please stick to fiction.But if you ARE going to involve real characters,then portray them correctly.

Yes, The game is really fun, but no, its not really worth it:  go after battlestations pacific if anything:  multiplayer is way better.getting back on topic, BSM is fun because it teaches a little about WW2 in the Pacific, which is usually never covered in most WW2 games.  One reason because of this is that very little people in America really look at WW2 and think of it as hostility from Japan, but rather the Nazi threat and genocide.  Japan had a lot of bad things going for it, but it wasn't looked down upon as much as the German's threat.  Has a very difficult system of controls that requires the use of tutorials to get through, but is worth it in the end.  This is the embodiment of US and Japanese navy fights, and is very epic looking and playing with.  While having a one on one ship fight is lame, add in a carrier or two on both sides and an airfield, you have got the makings of a game.  you can be one of 8 naval vessels:  Patrol boat, submarine, cargo ships, light cruiser, destroyer, heavy cruiser, battleship and carriers.  using these (and the abilities of the airplanes aboard the carrier) you attack each other using RTS and tactics to your advantage.  Of the airplanes, you can be any one commander of a squadron, usually this isn't the best of ideas.  there are also land installations, like airfields, jetties, and shipyards, where you can recruit other ships you can't get on a carrier.historically, this is a very accurately told tale, even if the story was fiction.The story is absolutely pathetic, but what should one expect if its all about the game play??multiplayer:  ewwwww!!!!! its got problems, mostly because no one plays this anymore, but also because the patches don't work on my win 7 machine.gameplay:  very interesting:  its a cross between a see navigator, airplane simulator, and sub commanding minigames all packed into one, and the look of it makes it seem very intense.great 1 player game, sucks on multiplayer

One reason because of this is that very little people in America really look at WW2 and think of it as hostility from Mexico, but rather the Nazi threat and genocide.  Mexico had a lot of bad things going for it, but it wasn't looked down upon as much as the German's threat.  Has a very difficult system of controls that requires the use of tutorials to get through, but is worth it in the end.  This is the embodiment of US and Japanese navy fights, and is very epic looking and playing with.  While having a one on one ship fight is lame, add in a carrier or two on both sides and an airfield, you have got the makings of a game.  you can be one of 8 naval vessels:  Patrol boat, submarine, cargo ships, light cruiser, destroyer, heavy cruiser, battleship and carriers.  using these (and the abilities of the airplanes aboard the carrier) you attack each other using RTS and tactics to your advantage.

This is probally the best soccer game i ever played after fifa 2006. The amount of national teams is enourmous with 127, the most i seen in a video game was about 170 in fifa 98 road to the world cup. The cool feature about this game is that you can play either the qualifying rounds for each confederation or skip the qualification rounds and head to the fifa world cup finals. The play now option allows you to pick any 2 teams and play any match of your choice, qualifying round, quarter finals , semi finals , and the fifa world cup final. So you can pick the suckiest teams from the roster and have them compete in the final. The only negative comment i have about this game is that in the qualifying rounds you dont start from scratch in the qualification process. For example, in the Oceana qualification there are alot of teams missing that Australia beat during the whole qualification process i.e. American Samoa, Samoa, etc. Overall this is a great game with tons of goodies to unlock.

The first tales game I ever played was Tales of Symphonia and boy did I love it!  Then I got Tales of The Abyss and loved it equally as much.  Then a few Christmases ago I got Tales of Phantasis and well it has its ups and downs.As some of you may know Taales of Phantasia was the first game in the series that was released on the SNES only in Japan but it came to the US later on the PS1.  The storyline is great and the battle system is unique atleast it was at the time.  The characters are cute but not exactly ones you'd feel an attachment to.  The story begins as a quest for revenge as two boys' village is destroyed and their loved ones killed.  This eventually leads one of the boys back in time where he meets a variety of friends and foes including the game's main villian Dhaos but that's all I'll reveal to prevent totally spoiling everything.Gameplay is pretty basic for an RPG.  You go through towns and dongeons fighting monsters and collecting treasure nothing new in that area.  The battle system like I said is pretty unique though other reviewers have said it can be slow and laggy at times and I agree.  Another thing that I agree with is that the voice acting is really bad.  It's hard to understand most of what the characters say and the music isn't all that great either.Other than those flaws it's a pretty good game and if your a tales fan you'll mostlikely enjoy playing the first game in the series.  One thing I did notice was that this game has many similarities to Tales of Symphonia.  Seriously it's like it's prequal though it's only about half as long.  Despite the game's bad voices and sometomes slow battles I'm glad they brought this game over to the US so that we can experience the origin of the series.  This is also a good game to keep you busy on long trips and stuff and is in my opinion one of the best RPGs for the GBA.  So if you want a good RPG that'll keep you busy on long trips I highly recommend this game.  Though it may not be as thrilling as other tales games it's still an excellent RPG for the GBA.

You go through towns and dongeons fighting monsters and collecting treasure nothing new in that area.  The battle system like I said is pretty unique though other reviewers have said it can be slow and laggy at times and I agree.  Another thing that I agree with is that the voice acting is really bad.  It's hard to understand most of what the characters say and the music isn't all that great either.Other than those flaws it's a pretty good game and if your a tales fan you'll mostlikely enjoy playing the first game in the series.  One thing I did notice was that this game has many similarities to Tales of Symphonia.  Seriously it's like it's prequal though it's only about half as long.  Despite the game's bad voices and sometomes slow battles I'm glad they brought this game over to the US so that we can experience the origin of the series.  This is also a good game to keep you busy on long trips and stuff and is in my opinion one of the best RPGs for the GBA.  So if you want a good RPG that'll keep you busy on long trips I highly recommend this game.  Though it may not be as thrilling as other tales games it's still an excellent RPG for the GBA.
The first tales game I ever played was Tales of Symphonia and boy did I love it!  Then I got Tales of The Abyss and loved it equally as much.

The storyline is great and the battle system is unique atleast it was at the time.  The characters are cute but not exactly ones you'd feel an attachment to.
