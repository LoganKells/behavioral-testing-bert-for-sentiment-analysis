I had this game originally  when I had the first DS Lite. Now I found myself ordering it gain when I got my 3DS. This is one of the best games I've ever played on a portable and if you've never explored it then you should because it's well worth it.

Zoo Tycoon is a pretty good adaption of the PC game to the DS format. The tracking is kinda slow, you can't zoom out enough for a decent overview, the sound FX are limited and you will get serious eyestrain with the small graphics. BUT, and it is a big BUT, this game is just as addictive as the PC format. You will have hours of fun building your zoo and keeping both animals and guest happy, and you will delight in problem busting when things need tweaking as the game progresses. Overall, this is a great game which is perfect when you can't play the full PC version and you'd like that great, addictive hit that this game brings. That's how I look at it. Well worth a buy for most DS game collections.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.

I have to be honest, i only bought this game because i wanted to try my ds online. When i first turned the game on that was the first thing i did. It was a lot of fun. Then i went to the regular gameplay, it was fun also. You cant do all the stuff online, but you can earn new cars to drive with. The only thing i have to say, is when racing online, try to race more than one person, because once they start losing they will drop out of the game causing you to lose. Even after going through ll the trouble of almost winning for the first time. Would definitely reccomend for the online play, and playing against your friends.

I don't want to think about how many hundreds of dollars I've spent on video games over the years for my son, but I have no complaints about this one- it has been the best of ALL. He's had it for YEARS now and it's still one of his all time favorites. It's not the type that he plays, conquers all the levels in a week and then never looks at again. Nor is it the type where he gets stuck on a level and it just becomes frustrating. It's a game that seems to be fun time after time after time. This is also a game you can play with another DS even if they don't have the game, which is SUPER fun. Sometimes I'll have up to 4 boys in the back of the car playing Mario Kart and having a blast while we're driving somewhere. Great game.

This is also a game you can play with another DS even if they don't have the game, which is SUPER fun. Sometimes I'll have up to 4 boys in the back of the car playing Mario Kart and having a blast while we're driving somewhere. Great game. I recommend this game.
I don't want to think about how many hundreds of dollars I've spent on video games over the years for my son, but I have no complaints about this one- it has been the best of ALL.

At first, this is a really fun game but my big problem with it is it's WAY TOO EASY.  Even on the hard settings, I had no problem. After you unlock everything, it gets very boring and I don't play it now.  It would be really good if it had a really hard level or more tracks to race on.  It was fun while it lasted but it's just not challenging enough.

This game has been with me for about a month now, I played as Demoness, found the adventure quite interesting,and the skill progression very informative and effective. The game is quite addictive, never a dull moment,there is always some adversary to fight, loot to collect and compare with already equipped things, magicallyhidden (don't show even with Alt pressed unless mouse cursor on them) stashes.There are save slots (3 of them) where you can save (and load from) at various stages, when you think it prudent.I prefer this way rather than automatic "Save and Exit" type of saving (like in Sacred 2: Fallen Angel, or Fate),where there is essentially only ONE saved game: if you choose, for example, to upgrade one skill,and this turns out to be not the best idea, Sacred: Gold allows you to load one of your previous versions,granting you a "redo" of sort, no such luck with the "Save and Exit" saving type.The quest compass, pointing to main (story line) quests, as wel as to currently active side quest, is a nice feature, as the Sacred world is vast. A detailed account is kept of monsters vanquished.Overall, a very well-made role-playing game, I am very pleased with Sacred Gold edition.

My favourite Nancy Drew game so far. Maybe because it was set on a train, the Hardy Boys were there, the puzzles were fun...basically all the elements of a good ND game. The atmosphere is exciting and I really liked the story too.

Winter Assault is one of those expansions that adds a lot of new content to a game. Since I have already posted a review of Dawn of War at this site, I won't go into too much detail here about this game. However, overall, this is a wonderful addition to one of my favorite games ever.The biggest change is the addition of a new race, the Imperial Guard. The Guard stresses entrenched defense as a tactic, backed up by strong vehicles and artillery. While not quite as flashy or alien as some of the other races, the Guard is a nice addition to the game. Also, the other four races each get a new unit, as well as modified tech trees which are well thought out.The single-player campaigns in Winter Assault are very well done. They allow you to play each of the races (except the Space Marines), and each mission has multiple parts and objectives. There is also a surprise appearance of another alien race in the last mission, which adds a nice twist to the story. Additionally, there are about 20 new multiplayer maps that come with Winter Assault.  The AI has been improved so that it's more aggressive, techs faster, and uses a diverse array of units.  There are some minor pathfinding issues for some units, but the game is just a blast to play.This game still looks great, and Winter Assault adds some new environments and weather effects. It's still a shame that the developer did not release modding tools with this version of the game, although I suspect that they will update the tools that can be downloaded from their website ([...] The sound effects are also quite good, and most of the new voices are done well, along with the new music.If you have any interest whatsoever in strategy games, then I highly recommend both the original game and this expansion. This is one of the best real-time strategy games I've played and is easily in the same league as Rise of Nations, Warcraft 3, and the Age of Empires series.

This is one of the best real-time strategy games I've played and is easily in the same league as Rise of Nations, Warcraft 3, and the Age of Empires series. The game is enjoyable.
Winter Assault is one of those expansions that adds a lot of new content to a game. Since I have already posted a review of Dawn of War at this site, I won't go into too much detail here about this game. However, overall, this is a wonderful addition to one of my favorite games ever.The biggest change is the addition of a new race, the Imperial Guard. The Guard stresses entrenched defense as a tactic, backed up by strong vehicles and artillery. While not quite as flashy or alien as some of the other races, the Guard is a nice addition to the game. Also, the other four races each get a new unit, as well as modified tech trees which are well thought out.The single-player campaigns in Winter Assault are very well done. They allow you to play each of the races (except the Space Marines), and each mission has multiple parts and objectives. There is also a surprise appearance of another alien race in the last mission, which adds a nice twist to the story. Additionally, there are about 20 new multiplayer maps that come with Winter Assault.  The AI has been improved so that it's more aggressive, techs faster, and uses a diverse array of units.

Mario Kart has been a franchise that I've always loved; it's simply the Mario world put onto a race track. I've played every Mario Kart game since the Super Nintendo version, and I must say that this is most definitely, in every single way, the best of them all. Here is my review.Graphics: 9/10. Smooth framerate ( somewhat choppy in WiFi mode ) in single player, great animations, nice looking tracks... this is a really good looking game, but they are not as good as they could have been. The graphics could have been cleaned up, and the game is somewhat glitchy. If you "snake" around a corner and almost hit the wall, you can see through it. It's nothing bad, just something to take note about.Sound: 9/10. Everything Mario. The karts sound good, the voices for the most part sound really nice ( except for DK and Bowser; it seems like some really bad impersonator tried to do their voices. ). The music is also really good... then again, what in this game isn't?Control: 8.5/10. It takes time to master "snaking", but once you get the hang of it, you will be king of the track every single game. The controls are very simple if you don't include using the "snake" button; all you have to do is drive... that's really it.Fun: 9.5/10. 8 player local, 4 player WiFi, 4 unlockable characters, 16 new tracks along with 16 classics, 36 selectable karts... this game has got it all. A downfall for this game though is definitely the blue shells. I constantly will find myself on the third lap about to cross the finish line, get hit by one, and get into second or third. It doesn't matter though; THIS IS THE BEST DS GAME OUT THERE RIGHT NOW. Hell, the only REAL problem for this game is that you will probably wish your DS's battery life was a lot longer.9.6/10

Phew - I'm relieved to be able to recommend this game.  I've played them all - in order.  And I really didn't enjoy the last two, so I was a bit concerned.But Her Interactive got a lot of things right in this one!  Interesting mystery, with the puzzles relatively seamlessly integrated into the plot.  Not too much repetition of tasks - hooray!The only reason it wasn't perfect, for me, was that I really didn't learn too much.  My favorite games are the ones where I walk away with a bit more knowledge of something than I had before going in.  And this one - not so much.I also had a small objection to the ending.  The "treasure", so to speak, was completely out of the park.  There had been nothing to indicate leading up to it that this was what we were seeking.

And I really didn't enjoy the last two, so I was a bit concerned.But Her Interactive got a lot of things right in this one!  Interesting mystery, with the puzzles relatively seamlessly integrated into the plot.  Not too much repetition of tasks - hooray!The only reason it wasn't perfect, for me, was that I really didn't learn too much.  My favorite games are the ones where I walk away with a bit more knowledge of something than I had before going in.  And this one - not so much.I also had a small objection to the ending.  The "treasure", so to speak, was completely out of the park.  There had been nothing to indicate leading up to it that this was what we were seeking.  And, as a history buff, I hated seeing such a "treasure" indeed relegated to the back-burner and used as a throw-away at the very end. This game is exciting.

I loved Mario Kart when it first came out on the SNES in the early 90s. I found the DS version to be just as fun - and far more portable!You get both the classic racetracks plus a few new ones. You get a variety of kart sizes and styles. Go for the small, super fast kart, or maybe opt for the larger, heavier one. It all depends on your gameplay style.In addition to the fun single player games, the DS wi-fi maeks it very easy to play online with up to 8 players! If you thought Mario Kart was fun zipping around against AI, you should try it against a few of your friends.If you want a bit of thinking, there are a variety of missions that you can take on. You can gather coins, try to beat time limits, and so on.I really appreciated that they didn't "touch screen" this to death. A lot of games brought to the DS go insane with touch screen features which make the game much harder to play. With Mario Kart, they use the lower screen for map information, which is really useful if you need it, but is nicely out of the way if you don't. It's the best of both worlds.What's really great about this game is that all ages love it. It's a game that grandparents can play with their grandkids for hours and hours and really have fun doing it.Highly recommended!

This game might have been good for its time just as FF before it..however I feel that this game lacks everything that made the FF series so famous...FUN. I had more trouble trying to figure out how to modify the graphic preferances and how to navigate my character than actually trying to figure out how to play the stupid game. And come on now..most fo the characters in the game look just outright retarded...but hey If you want a good game then play World of Warcraft or Elder scrolls 4...

The Mario Kart franchise is one of the most popular and sold gaming franchises every made.  And there is a reason for that.  Because the game is just a total blast to play.  And this Mario Kart DS game is no exception.  The game is truly fun to play.  Yes newer more recent games have been released which I am sure are much better than this one.  But if you would like to save a little money and want to experience all the rage about Mario Kart, this would be a fantastic start.

The Mario Kart franchise is one of the most popular and sold gaming franchises every made.  And there is a reason for that.  Because the game is just a total blast to play.

Difficulty:Just RightTime Spent:40 to 100 HoursThe Bottom Line:"Great multiplayer"This game features characters like Peach, Mario, Luigi, Bowser, Toad, Wario and Yoshi and hidden characters such as Waluigi, Dry Bones, R.O.B. and Daisy. Each character has their own stats, strengths and weaknesses. For beginners I'd recommend Toad or Mario.The levels are fun and the multiplayer is even funner. The game's strengths are that you can come back and come back for more and it doesn't get boring and tried and true for a while. Also, the graphics are pleasant while pushing no boundaries.Levels are your typical Mario Kart affair but many boards from past games return which was fun to see (especially Frappe Snowland and Moo Moo Farm).You can play with others that are local or you can rev up the game online through Wi-Fi with people from the states or from all over the world which was neat (but sometimes takes a while).There are also one player mini games that you can excel at called Missions. VS enables you to race against friends and Battle let's you play one of three battle modes.Learning Curve: 0-10 minutes.Graphics: 8/10Sound: 7.5/10Controls: 9.5/10Gameplay & Fun: 8/10Overall, this game gets an 8/10, being accessible to nearly anyone.B-(taken from gamespot, under the name darksongbird)

The only problem with this game is that you really need to pay attention to the environment to pick up some things, like if you walk past a statue you will have to notice the spade icon comes up and you can use it. It requires a really focussed mind, and you get rewards if you're good.But, on the other hand, the game makes some things blatantly obvious: eg where to go next, who can see you, who has something for you, where's the goal, etc. It's good, but it is a sort of irony- it makes it easy for you and hard as well. But then the game is not that hard... it makes you make decisions. The story is very well written, and I'm happy with everything else. The graphics are good, music, combat. Although the system gets you more involved than KOTOR.90%

well compared to the original Game Cube one it just doesn't compare... there is way to much lag and overly long loading screens. which was very annoying while playing it.

When Nintendo was the master of the home console gaming world, Atari was on it's way out, and Sega entered the fray with the flawed but fun Master system.  Hardware wise the Master is better than the original NES, with somewhat better graphics and sound, but the game library was sadly lacking.  Since Nintendo pretty much had all the third party support it could muster, Sega practically had mainly their first party titles to release for it.  Many of them were watered down ports of their arcade titles, but they were nontheless fun games for the system.  The Master isn't a bad system at all, but it wouldn't be until the 16-bit era that Sega would release the Genesis; which would catapault the company to success.  Below is a list of the best games available for the Sega Master system:After BurnerSpace HarrierOutrunDouble DragonY'sPhantasy Star

There was just so much that video games have made in themselves today. However much you can constantly enjoy what is now hot in arcade classics, you can never ever forget the past, and what influences have been made from it. So many classics from Pac Man to Donkey Kong and Pong still have been as dominat now, as they were back then. For Namco, they still have made that as constant as it was back in the 70's and 80's. They've made previous versions of compilations of their classics for the Game Boy, Gamecube, and Xbox to name a few. Now the Namco museum has just reissued their classic lineup yet again.Namco Museum 50th Anniversary Arcade Collection for the Nintendo Gamecube really isn't anything out of the ordinary as it was released awhile back. The game compilation features so many classics that were previously released on the Gamecube edition. This edition add on to it with a whole ordeal of extra games to match. You have some great classic games from the past including Pac Man, Xevious, which was a bonus if you have previously played Star Fox Assault, Dig Dug, and so many others just to name a few. The games have been remastered very well, without little flaws. The control and gameplay enjoyment is just as simple and enjoyable as it was released years ago from the arcades.While so many might not consider classics from the past, Namco Museum 50th Anniversary Arcade Collection really does deliver for nostalgic video game buffs. While so many would rather get a fancier game with enhanced surround sound, you can never deny those classics that are just a bite away.Graphics: B-Sound: B+Control: B+Fun & Enjoyment: B 1/2+Overall: B 1/2+

I never played the first Katamari but this one I picked up out of impulse. I heard from everywhere that it was great but I was afraid that my friends would find out that I bought it because the cover is all colorful and it looks like a kids game while you're playing. Everything is all colorful and whimsical and theres rainbows and crap. Plus, theres skipping. You can skip around the landscape in the level selection menu and if you pass another person like you, they follow you, skipping and singing. It's very very very gay. And yet, it's one of the best games I've played. It's original and just tons and tons of fun. Plus, it's incredibly addictive. I had to go somewhere the day after I got it and the whole time, all I could think about was this game. I couldn't wait to get home and play it. The game is awesome but they could have at least made the cover less colorful. Maybe have a gun and a couple hobos in a back alley on the cover  just so I wouldn't be embarassed when people are looking at my game collection and see a title with a heart on it and colorful creatures around a colorful  house... ugh.
I never played the first Katamari but this one I picked up out of impulse. I heard from everywhere that it was great but I was afraid that my friends would find out that I bought it because the cover is all colorful and it looks like a kids game while you're playing. Everything is all colorful and whimsical and theres rainbows and crap. Plus, theres skipping.

This game really is awesome! First of all, it has great replay value. After you beat the game, you can still go back and try to get a higher score on that cup. You can also challenge yourself to get first in every ace, or lap someone. The graphics are all spectacular, from the karts to the track to the characters.Tons of stuff to unlock, too, like new karts and characters. If the racing bores you, you can have a go at the Balloon Battles and Shine Runners. Or, you could do the time trials and set the best time, and send the ghost to your friend to see if they can beat it.

i haven't played this game much yet (i guess that says it all), but here's my impression so far.  this game is advertised for its great multiplayer, yet i had no such experience.  for one thing, the maps are pretty bad.  they're really small and the whole game simply feels like counterstrike with star wars graphics.  sure, the graphics are really good, but what about the gameplay?  well, at times it's fun, but here's my biggest complaint - WHO ARE THE ENEMIES?  for god's sake, would it kill them to make it easier to see who's on your team and who's on the other team??  in a game like call of duty, each side has different uniforms so it's obvious.  to make it even worse, servers use friendly fire.  so i'm running around just trying to figure out who to shoot.  some of the weapons are quite cool, but i had some problems.  would it kill them to put in a description in the game of what weapons do what?  i used the incinerator on people and nothing happens.  and what all can those tongs be used for?  what's going on?!  granted i should probably read the instruction manual, but if i wanted to read, i'd read a book.as far as the space fighting, the graphics are great, but the gameplay was TERRIBLE.  i couldn't figure out how to find the enemies in the vastness of space, how to shoot them or anything.  i think this kind of thing should be somewhat intuitive.  i don't play flight sims or anything, but i can easily figure out how to fly a plane... if you make it intuitive.on the plus side, the single player is good so far.  i'm curious as to whether battlefront 1 is a better multiplayer game than this, but i'm not sure i want to spend the money to find out.

...a really great game. First off, there are a whole bunch of great and fun game modes, including the grand prix, time trial, and even a mission mode. Second, the movement of the racers is not messed up, at all by the fact that you're playing this game on a handheld system. Third, the graphics are still top-tier for DS, even 6 years later and I don't mean that in a bad way. Fourth, there are some new racetracks and some that have been brought back, from previous MarioKart games. Fifth, you only need one game card for wireless battles against your friends and if you are not in possession of a game card, when you race in vs, you get to play as an exclusive character. Sixth, the bonus games are a lot more fun on this handheld system. So, what I'm trying to say: this game rules and it is pretty much the perfect port.

Sometimes, that's where the good memories start to roll through because you want to remember the games in the past and keep playing them until this day. It's fun to play Pac-Man and Galaga, Ping Pong, which is fun for 2 Players. I just like playing Pac-Man, Galaga, Pole Position I and II, Ms. Pac-Man. And they are memorable games from the Atari, I wish they had Donkey Kong from Atari, which I that was a lot of fun to play with. The special feature is the Adventure games in Galaga and Pac-Man and those games you won't die. So, this is a game to play and remember.

snaking alone takes a star away from this.. also less characters and worse tracks, graphics, music, controls, and items than mario kart 7.  great for its time but mk7 improves in just about every area

I traded in some games and got this. First off, this game is VERY challenging. Second is that it is up to 8 players using only 1 card! You may think you won just because you got 1'st, but they also grade your driving skill. If you like fun games, get this game!

This works well charging my GBA SP, but it feels like it was cheaply made.I recommend it if you don't have the money to buy the OEM charger and need something in a pinch!

The older graphics are pretty cheesy, but all the ND computer games are lots of fun :)  No less than 4 stars for all the games they make!

At first when I got this game, I was expecting it to be... OK. But, was I wrong! This is an awesome game and the missions aren't easy! There are 3 modes Single player, which you can play with yourself, multiplayer, which you can play wirelessly your friends up to 65 feet away, and the best one...Nintendo WFC. With WFC you just jump in and race random people... or your friends!, you get 4 modes. They are Regional (race with people in your region), worldwide(race with people all around the world), rivals (race with people with the same skills as you), or friends. To race a friend, first both of you must meet together and exchange friend codes, and enter them, and be on WFC at the same exact time.With multiplayer, even if you're the only one that has a game card, you can stiil race with up to 7 other friends! In single player, their are 5 modes, Grand Prix, VS, mission, time trial, and battle. Their is only one probem with the game though. On WFC, there are so many hackers! About 70 percent of them are. They have cheats like unlimited lighting strikes which keeps zapping you so you can't move or anything. Then the only thing you can do is turn of your ds and then turn back on and wait another 3 minutes for the WFC race to begin! They can hack by buying this thing called "Action Replay Dsi" for $20. It has all sorts of hacks from zapping you so much that you can't move to getting unlimited powerups. Also, when someone is hacking their is no way to report it, so they can keep doing it. So, if you don't hack in WFC (which is great) don't expect to win alot of races!

This is by far the best of the Evil Dead games.  Controls are easy to learn and switching from weapon to weapon is simple. While there are some puzzles to the game, they actually make sense so they aren't nearly as annoying as some other games (the Resident Evil games come to mind).  The graphics are excellent and add to overall gameplay significantly.  Intended for mature gameplayers, this game has plenty of hack and slash.  Camera angles, for once, don't seem to be a problem and  the gameplay is fun and not overly difficult.  Voice acting is superb and is quite entertaining, especially the cut scenes.  Speaking of the cut scenes, they really took time to make this game appear like the original Evil Dead movie. The story line moves along at a quick pace but is not the least bit confusing.  The only problem with this game is how short it is.  I beat it as a rental in just a couple of days and never played it for more than a couple of hours at a time, leaving the replay value low.  However, with most games in the $50 range, this under $20 gem is a must have for anyone interested in action/horror games or a fan of the Evil Dead series.

The graphics are excellent and add to overall gameplay significantly.  Intended for mature gameplayers, this game has plenty of hack and slash.  Camera angles, for once, don't seem to be a problem and  the gameplay is fun and not overly difficult.  Voice acting is superb and is quite entertaining, especially the cut scenes.  Speaking of the cut scenes, they really took time to make this game appear like the original Evil Dead movie. The story line moves along at a quick pace but is not the least bit confusing.  The only problem with this game is how short it is.  I beat it as a rental in just a couple of days and never played it for more than a couple of hours at a time, leaving the replay value low.  However, with most games in the $50 range, this under $20 gem is a must have for anyone interested in action/horror games or a fan of the Evil Dead series. This game was beautiful.
* Friendliest game for kids.* Good enough to make you jump at the challenge.* Instant rewards at the end of succesful racing.* Great for 4 yr olds.

I'm going to make this short and bitter.  I rented both NBA 2K6 and Live and let me tell you... thank God that the NBA didn't sell exclusive right to EA.  Sega has made a much superior game.  The biggest flaw that I could find (I don't have online) is that the difficultly level for the computer has no inbetween.  What I mean is that its either to easy or to difficult.  I would rather get beat by the computer than blow them out but cheap loses are retarded.Rent this game to make sure that its for you... don't bother renting NBA Live it just plain sucks.

I currently own Sacred and Sacred Underworld expansion pack. I was happy to find out I could export my character from Sacred to Sacred Underworld. I have been unhappy with the fact that after you have battled and beaten all the baddies to reach an objective, you have to battle them all over again to get out. Maybe I've been spoiled by games such as Divine Divinity and Neverwinter Nights where once these things are bearten they stay beaten. I,ve heard that they are releasing a new updated version on DVD that supposed to be more balanced. I will probably give these two to my nephew and get the Gold edition as overall it is a really good game although frustrating at times. Charlie Spivey.... Richmond Va.

I've rented dozens of DS games and have purchased about 8 of them, and Mario Kart DS is, in my opinion, the best game current available for the system.The single player is robust, with many, MANY different types of play. Missions, Time Trials, racing against ghosts, Grand Prix, mirred tracks, ect..There is a spectacular amount of content in the game. The game is also very well polished. No bugs, no crashing. The menu's are very simple.It's amazing how much greatness they can squeeze into that little cart that's the size of a postage stamp.I spend a lot of time playing wireless against friends, and is definately one of the best aspects of the game. You can win by pure driving skill, just like all the other racing games, but what sets mario kart above the rest is that the items opens up a strategic element to the game that very few other racers have. You can win by using your items intelligently, or you can win by perfecting the art of cornering and power boosting. This gives the game a lot of diversity.As you progress through the game, winning races, new characters and carts and classes unlock. This keeps you motivated through the single player campaign. Once you do unlock everything, you will be very pleased with just how much content the game has.The physics and handling of the karts are just right. It is arcade style racing, but yet diverse and technical enough to reward skilled drivers. It's easy to learn, but difficult to master, and thats one of the greatest things about it.The graphics are very smooth, very colorful. The sound effects are great and give it a lot of personality and charm. The wifi play gives the game longevity. I've played a couple hundred wifi matches so far, and im ready to play hundreds more.Don't even both renting the game, just buy it, it will keep you busy for a looong time.

This gives the game a lot of diversity.As you progress through the game, winning races, new characters and carts and classes unlock. This keeps you motivated through the single player campaign. Once you do unlock everything, you will be very pleased with just how much content the game has.The physics and handling of the karts are just right. It is arcade style racing, but yet diverse and technical enough to reward skilled drivers. It's easy to learn, but difficult to master, and thats one of the greatest things about it.The graphics are very smooth, very colorful. The sound effects are great and give it a lot of personality and charm. The wifi play gives the game longevity. I've played a couple hundred wifi matches so far, and im ready to play hundreds more.Don't even both renting the game, just buy it, it will keep you busy for a looong time. This game was engaging.
I've rented dozens of DS games and have purchased about 8 of them, and Mario Kart DS is, in my opinion, the best game current available for the system.The single player is robust, with many, MANY different types of play. Missions, Time Trials, racing against ghosts, Grand Prix, mirred tracks, ect..There is a spectacular amount of content in the game. The game is also very well polished. No bugs, no crashing. The menu's are very simple.It's amazing how much greatness they can squeeze into that little cart that's the size of a postage stamp.I spend a lot of time playing wireless against friends, and is definately one of the best aspects of the game.

There's a reason this game has been in the top DS games list for over 1400 days. The limited controls (only directional pad and 2 buttons) of the Nintendo DS work out perfectly for this game as you feel like you're holding onto an old NES controller while you cruise around the racetracks. Half of the games courses are also throwbacks to prior releases of Mario Kart on various platforms including Game Boy Advance and Nintendo 64. All of the courses are fun to play and the difficulty can be customized by choosing either 50cc (novice), 100cc (intermediate), or 150cc (expert). There are a wide array of characters and karts to choose and just like in previous versions there are banana peels and turtle shells and all sorts of items to pick up and launch at other players during the race.The best feature of this game is the online play where you can see how good you really are compared to other real people out there. There are also a large number of courses so even just beating the game in 1 player mode takes quite a bit of time. The one negative I can think of is that the game does move pretty fast visually and due to the small screen size of the Nintendo DS it can get a little dizzying at times (particularly if you're playing on a moving car or airplane). Overall this is a fantastic game and definitely worth the $30 price tag. Like I said, there's a reason why a game stays as a best seller for 1400 days and you don't see many used copies for sale at your local Gamestop.

This is a really good game, great controls, voice acting and graphics. If you're a Evil Dead fan this is a must have. It's fun and it's not extremely difficult or frustrating. This is definately worth $20. I thought it was cool that this one and Fistful of Boomstick were both $20 when they came out. Don't we all wish every game would be like this. Regeneration beats most of the $50 games out there right now.

My cousin bought this game the 4th day it came out and we started playing it. We were impressed, very impressed. DOR2 has more to this game then the 1st one. The graphics are amazing. New characters like Eugene, Muhamad Hussan, Rene Dupree (Comes out with fe'fe), Cristy Hemmy, (But no Lita grrrr). I'm kind of saden about the legends though not really. Stone Cold Steve Austin, Hogan, The Rock, and Mankind (But no Andre). The New submission and Stamina system are great in this game. There are a couple of glitches and loading sucks. But other than that This game beats all other wrestling games. This maybe the last THQ wrestling game for GC (Probably DOR3 for Revolution) but this is the greatest of all time. Don't rent it. Buy it you'll love it

My cousin bought this game the 4th day it came out and we started playing it. We were impressed, very impressed. DOR2 has more to this game then the 1st one. The graphics are amazing. New characters like Eugene, Muhamad Hussan, Rene Dupree (Comes out with fe'fe), Cristy Hemmy, (But no Lita grrrr). I'm kind of saden about the legends though not really. Stone Cold Steve Austin, Hogan, The Rock, and Mankind (But no Andre). The New submission and Stamina system are great in this game. There are a couple of glitches and loading sucks. But other than that This game beats all other wrestling games. This maybe the last THQ wrestling game for GC (Probably DOR3 for Revolution) but this is the greatest of all time. Don't rent it. Buy it you'll love it. The game is extraordinary.

Probably the quirkiest platformer ever created, Earthworm Jim is a terrifically amusing title and a classic piece of video game history. Though the game has graced many other consoles, from its counterpart on the Sega Genesis to its more recent high-definition versions on the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3, I tend to favor the SNES rendition for its comprehensive controls and admittingly, slight nostalgic value. However, if you find yourself without a Super Nintendo or Sega Genesis, I would still highly recommend this game even if it doesn't come with the added tickle of a classic controller in hand.The gameplay in Earthworm Jim is fairly straightforward, playing in a classic platformer/pseudo run-and-gun fashion. The wild and insanely bizarre worlds are filled with odd-looking and ferocious dogs, pesky birds and plenty of outlandish bosses. You will find your face stuck in a permanently confused and awkwardly giddy position the entire experience as you are constantly bombarded with one nonsensical scenario after the other. It's this peculiarity and unconventional approach that makes Earthworm Jim a unique and unmatched triumph. Get this worm before it's gone!

This is a great kart-based racing game that Nintendo knows inside and out. There is a good amount of customization and the characters are colorful & animated. This is a game for all audiences as well. There are tons of tracks that you can play over and over to get the best grade/amount of stars, and multi player and wifi connection makes this game great with your friends/family, and even with people around the world! I bought this game about 4 years ago and it is still one of the games I play most on my DS. In all, don't hesitate to buy this game. It truly a "must-have" for the DS and will be a fun playing experience for you and everyone else you decide to race against!

I wasn't a big fan of the old AOE series, but I decided to take this one seriously. One of the things you will notice in this game is that blowing up stuff seems more fun than it use to be back in the old days. The game is divided into three parts, and they all link up into a great storyline. Graphic is like nothing you will find in previous strategy games. All the smoke effects are in there from cannon recoiling, a battalion of musketeers loading off their rifle to buildings blowing off, even fogging up in jungle maps. Destroying building just doesn't get any better than this. These medieval buildings actually look and sound like they were flaking off as you attack them. The maps, especially the jungle maps looks extremely vivid and alive, everything just look so natural. Animals are roaming all over the map in groups, some lethal, and others are delicious. The water looks so shiny it like a mirror, and the sun shining off the surface looks incredible, I haven't found this effect in any other strategy game. I was disappointed that the ships in this game didn't make waves as they move. They pretty much flake off as you attack them just like the buildings. By the way, some of the advance ships are humongous, they even outsize most of the buildings; seeing 3 of them means that you are screwed. There is also this card system, which makes your job easier, but they must be unlocked. To make your job easier, these cards let your home city import supplies right to the battlefield. I had fun with this game, and you will too.

The water looks so shiny it like a mirror, and the sun shining off the surface looks incredible, I haven't found this effect in any other strategy game. I was disappointed that the ships in this game didn't make waves as they move. They pretty much flake off as you attack them just like the buildings. By the way, some of the advance ships are humongous, they even outsize most of the buildings; seeing 3 of them means that you are screwed. There is also this card system, which makes your job easier, but they must be unlocked. To make your job easier, these cards let your home city import supplies right to the battlefield. I had fun with this game, and you will too. This game is excellent.
I wasn't a big fan of the old AOE series, but I decided to take this one seriously. One of the things you will notice in this game is that blowing up stuff seems more fun than it use to be back in the old days. The game is divided into three parts, and they all link up into a great storyline. Graphic is like nothing you will find in previous strategy games. All the smoke effects are in there from cannon recoiling, a battalion of musketeers loading off their rifle to buildings blowing off, even fogging up in jungle maps.

I got this game for my ''I LOVE MARIO CHARCTERS'' child. She would not stop playing it. She said'' daddy,watch this.It is awesome!'' So, I  watched her. It had really good animations. She kept playing for the day, nearly. She finally said something. It looked really fun. She always plays Yoshi.  When my mom got this for my daughter for christmas , I thought " oh brother!" Then, I saw she really liked it. She is a addicts, espically that day.I wanted to bring it back because it was almost 40.00! My mom usally does this stuff. But,luckily is was a game she liked. So, It was a F.U.N game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This is a cute game, but really needs to be played on a larger unit.  My PSP playing area is just too small for getting through the puzzles.

I bought this for my kids.  They love playing it, especially since they all have DSes, so they can race each other.  Recommended.

This game is exactly the kind of game I like to play.  You can complete missions for a feeling of accomplishment and at the same time advance the larger mission and build up your character.  Well worth the money.

Urban Reign is one of those game that will appeal to a certain audience and was made for specific type of gamers. Its a beat em up game similar to final fight, death by degrees etc. Created by the same team that brought you the Tekken series it has that Tekken feel to it like that electric sprite you get whenever you hit someone.It has has all the makings of a beat em up urban areas, gangs to beat upc, weapons like bats, pipes, etc. The story is not something you'll really focus about, basically your a brawler for hire named Brad Hawk who goes around beating up various gangs and their members to rid the streets of urban chaos, well for the second half at least for the first half your just beating up people left and right just for the hell of it.Ok so the story is out of the way, now the gameplay its fighting from stage to stage just beating up people by whatever means but on occasion you'll be tasked to damage a enemies leg or their arms. Now there's 99 missions and this why I gave the game 4 stars the levels can get repetitive because you'll be revisiting the same areas but with different enemies. And this is the same with boss characters you'll fight the same ones again; first by themselves and then with more enemies by their sides, its lazy but hey I guess they had to stretch the 99 mission some how.Now this game is notorious for its sudden peak in difficulty, this is why I said its meant for specific gamers. If you like beat em up games, not fighting game that's just one on one;in this game you'll have guys coming at you from all sides juggling you to the point that it feels cheap and this can be maddening on the later levels. But one thing I like is that there is Multiplayer which helps you forget about how difficult the later missions can get. You can play with a buddy or just duke it out with more players in a deathmatch type modes; the multiplayers is the best part about this game.Urban Reign is a game for those who want the old school beat em up experience with challenging opponents who are just as tough as you. The multiplayer is a great add on that relieves the game that other wise would of been to hard for casual gamers.

You can play with a buddy or just duke it out with more players in a deathmatch type modes; the multiplayers is the best part about this game.Urban Reign is a game for those who want the old school beat em up experience with challenging opponents who are just as tough as you. The multiplayer is a great add on that relieves the game that other wise would of been to hard for casual gamers. I recommend this game.
Urban Reign is one of those game that will appeal to a certain audience and was made for specific type of gamers. Its a beat em up game similar to final fight, death by degrees etc. Created by the same team that brought you the Tekken series it has that Tekken feel to it like that electric sprite you get whenever you hit someone.It has has all the makings of a beat em up urban areas, gangs to beat upc, weapons like bats, pipes, etc. The story is not something you'll really focus about, basically your a brawler for hire named Brad Hawk who goes around beating up various gangs and their members to rid the streets of urban chaos, well for the second half at least for the first half your just beating up people left and right just for the hell of it.Ok so the story is out of the way, now the gameplay its fighting from stage to stage just beating up people by whatever means but on occasion you'll be tasked to damage a enemies leg or their arms. Now there's 99 missions and this why I gave the game 4 stars the levels can get repetitive because you'll be revisiting the same areas but with different enemies. And this is the same with boss characters you'll fight the same ones again; first by themselves and then with more enemies by their sides, its lazy but hey I guess they had to stretch the 99 mission some how.Now this game is notorious for its sudden peak in difficulty, this is why I said its meant for specific gamers.

Before I start writing this review, I just wanted to say that I've never played the GameCube version so, I won't be comparing the two.THE PROS:=It's surprisingly addictive! It started out with me just renting it, two weeks later, I was purchasing it so I could play it longer without having to pay to extend the rental time. I've played through the entire game 3 times and it still doesn't get old.=There's lots of possibilities in this game. You can run your farm and life how you want to; marry the girl you want, be friends with who you want, choose the way you want to make your riches.=Expand. As you make money, you can buy extra stuff to put on your farm, either to decorate it or give it a function that it didn't previously have.=Nice soundtrack. Though it's just instrumental stuff, it's mostly happy music that you can't help but smile when you hear some of the tracks.THE CONS:=There's moments where you will run different speeds depending on location and time of day. The game somehow speeds up a little down near Cody's house in the midday, making you run/ride at a faster than usual pace. Also, you seem to run/ride slower around the spring area any time of day.=Loading screens and exiting & entering buildings takes several seconds and can sometimes just be more of a personal frustration than a practical one. Days where I'm relaxed in-real-life, I don't mind the waiting times, other days it bugs the crap out of me.=Having vibration on makes your character pause for a second after jumping over the pasture fence. Don't know why, but it does.=The colors aren't as bright and vivid as I would like them to be, but it's not really a con, just a personal preference.The cons aside, this is still one of my favorite games. I didn't think I'd like such a game, but it's definitely something that everyone should try playing just once.

You can run your farm and life how you want to; marry the girl you want, be friends with who you want, choose the way you want to make your riches.=Expand. As you make money, you can buy extra stuff to put on your farm, either to decorate it or give it a function that it didn't previously have.=Nice soundtrack. Though it's just instrumental stuff, it's mostly happy music that you can't help but smile when you hear some of the tracks.THE CONS:=There's moments where you will run different speeds depending on location and time of day. The game somehow speeds up a little down near Cody's house in the midday, making you run/ride at a faster than usual pace. Also, you seem to run/ride slower around the spring area any time of day.=Loading screens and exiting & entering buildings takes several seconds and can sometimes just be more of a personal frustration than a practical one. Days where I'm relaxed in-real-life, I don't mind the waiting times, other days it bugs the crap out of me.=Having vibration on makes your character pause for a second after jumping over the pasture fence. Don't know why, but it does.=The colors aren't as bright and vivid as I would like them to be, but it's not really a con, just a personal preference.The cons aside, this is still one of my favorite games. I didn't think I'd like such a game, but it's definitely something that everyone should try playing just once. I recommend this game.
Before I start writing this review, I just wanted to say that I've never played the GameCube version so, I won't be comparing the two.THE PROS:=It's surprisingly addictive! It started out with me just renting it, two weeks later, I was purchasing it so I could play it longer without having to pay to extend the rental time. I've played through the entire game 3 times and it still doesn't get old.=There's lots of possibilities in this game.

Though the NES was better and had better games, this SMS was an awesome home console.  The color was slightly better then the NES and it had some really unique top notch games. Ah memories.

It is impressive what they have been able to cram into such a small form-factor.Pros:- very varied environments that are relatively large.- varied environments also offer unique environmental characteristics that come into play in the game- like turrets.- get to blow up a star destroyer.- the instant action games featuring essentially deathmatch with jedi are fun- fight as either yoda, mace, ki-adi-mundi, aayla secura, obiwan, luke, han, leia, boba fett, darth vader, maul, anakin, & the emperor- conquest mode plays like Risk and motivates you to fight thru all the battles.- Soundtrack consists of classic star wars themesCons:- Controls are difficult- mainly because of limited PSP controls.- Space battles in conquest mode are very repetitive.- after the conquest game is over, where you have gone thru over 20 campaigns, the game just says "Victory"... That's it, no celebration of any sort, no ending cutscene- talk about a lazy way to end the game.- Controls in game are not correctly documented in manual. Best to use Default controls even though Basic is easier. Default controls allow your jedi to block. Basic controls do not.A decent title for the PSP. Well worth getting when it hits discount. Worth getting new for SW fans that have played all the games.

Another great SNK (this time in conjunction with Ignition) release. The presentation is extraordinary, especially for a PS2 game this late in the system's life cycle. I can't stress just how professional and beautiful the presentation is of KOF 98. Unbelievable!Contains both the original AND updated versions! Plus various modes.Plus, there is a bonus disc!!5 stars, highly recommended!

My favorite title for the 'touch-screened wonder' as of yet. Very addictive. Way better than the N64 Version, yet more compact. See how advanced technology can get in only about 6 years? Heres the bare-boned details: LOADS of tracks from original SNES Mario Kart, N64 Mario Kart, and They've even managed to put a few tracks from the Double Dash Mario Karts for the Gamecube! How cool is that?! More character than any of the other Mario Karts plus a few unlockable ones. (Waluigi, Drybones [skeleton Koopa Troopa] and some other one of which I haven't yet Unlocked, I think it it maybe a Black Shyguy. Anyways theres also a 'Mission Mode' where you can defeat bosses by ramming into them/Shooting items at them ETC.They've also brought back the 'Battle Mode' where you have some lives and you keep shooting items at eachother. There is an awesome 'Battle Mode' Stage where your battling ontop of a giant silver Nintendo DS and you can drive up from the bottom screen to the top by going up through the middle where the Wires are hidden and allows you to open the DS up. Lastly is Wi-FI. (Too bad I got a 56k modem ='( you need Wireless Internet to use it. If you search google though there are companies that make Wi-Fi deviced specifically for Dial-up users but playing mario karts on them would be Slower than they come.  Toodles! =') Buy this game!

There is an awesome 'Battle Mode' Stage where your battling ontop of a giant silver Nintendo DS and you can drive up from the bottom screen to the top by going up through the middle where the Wires are hidden and allows you to open the DS up. Lastly is Wi-FI. (Too bad I got a 56k modem ='( you need Wireless Internet to use it. If you search google though there are companies that make Wi-Fi deviced specifically for Dial-up users but playing mario karts on them would be Slower than they come.  Toodles! =') Buy this game. The game is perfect.
My favorite title for the 'touch-screened wonder' as of yet. Very addictive. Way better than the N64 Version, yet more compact. See how advanced technology can get in only about 6 years? Heres the bare-boned details: LOADS of tracks from original SNES Mario Kart, N64 Mario Kart, and They've even managed to put a few tracks from the Double Dash Mario Karts for the Gamecube! How cool is that?! More character than any of the other Mario Karts plus a few unlockable ones.

This game begins with you, as Nancy Drew, invited by the Hardy Boys to solve a strange 100 year old mystery: What happened to Jake Hurley? Lori Girard, a wannabe actress who will do anything for attention, invited a world-known detective, a television star, a romance novelist, and the Hardy Boys to help discover anything that will lead to Jake Hurley's mine, which no one ever found. But when Lori mysteriously disappears, the real personalities of these people come out. Nancy Drew, with the help of the Hardy Boys, discovers the real reason why one passenger wanted to find Jake Hurley's abandoned mine.Overall, it was fun to play, but hard to follow the story, which surprised me because usually HerInteractive does a very nice job with the story. The game was not overly easy, but not overly difficult either. I found my self going online only twice for help. And, as always, the graphics and the music is amazing! Another great job HerInteractive! 5 Stars!

If you've read any of my other reviews on DS games, you might have heard me say this before....One thing I'll have to hand to Nintendo, even though they might not have alot in quantity of games for the Nintendo DS, what games that are released for the system are of good quality. Not once have I bought a game that wasn't fun, addictive or deep in gameplay. Sadly, I hate to admit, I can't say that with the Playstation Portable. Sure, some games were flawed(course, all games have flaws of some sort). And, sure, the graphics aren't of PSP calibur but who really cares when the games are this good. Take Mario Kart DS, for instance...it took awhile to come out but it was well worth the wait. With over 30 courses drawn from every Mario Kart game -Super Mario Kart, Mario Kart 64, Mario Kart: Super Circuit, and Mario Kart: Double Dash, Mario Kart DS is a game that's not to be missed. The all-star cast includes characters you all know and love like..Mario, Luigi, Peach, Yoshi, Konkey Kong, Wario, Bowser,and Toad.  The game also allows up to eight players to play with only one copy. The best thing about the game is the Wi-Fi gameplay. I'm surprised with its' more ambitious gameplay. I don't have any gripes with this game in any way.I simply adored Mario Kart: Super Circuit for the Gameboy Advance. It was an absolute blast to play through. Mario Kart DS is no different. Keeping with the tried and true Mario Kart formula, Mario Kart DS will surely please Mario Kart and Racing fans alike.

I don't have any gripes with this game in any way.I simply adored Mario Kart: Super Circuit for the Gameboy Advance. It was an absolute blast to play through. Mario Kart DS is no different. Keeping with the tried and true Mario Kart formula, Mario Kart DS will surely please Mario Kart and Racing fans alike. This game was adorable.
If you've read any of my other reviews on DS games, you might have heard me say this before....One thing I'll have to hand to Nintendo, even though they might not have alot in quantity of games for the Nintendo DS, what games that are released for the system are of good quality. Not once have I bought a game that wasn't fun, addictive or deep in gameplay. Sadly, I hate to admit, I can't say that with the Playstation Portable. Sure, some games were flawed(course, all games have flaws of some sort). And, sure, the graphics aren't of PSP calibur but who really cares when the games are this good. Take Mario Kart DS, for instance...it took awhile to come out but it was well worth the wait. With over 30 courses drawn from every Mario Kart game -Super Mario Kart, Mario Kart 64, Mario Kart: Super Circuit, and Mario Kart: Double Dash, Mario Kart DS is a game that's not to be missed.

Nancy Drew: Last Train to Blue Moon Canyon... I would definitely recommend you purchase this interactive mystery PC game!!  The graphics are vibrant; the sound effects are very good and add a key element to your game play; the characters are interesting; the clues keep you thinking and looking for answers; and Nancy will not let you down!  She is not afraid to hunt wherever she must!  The train ride seems realistic, as you pass from one car to the next.  You get to use a cell phone camera at some point.  One reviewer said it's too short, however, my experience (as an adult) is that it is just the right length, especially for a $20 game.  I don't try to race through the game, rather I save it and then go back.  It's up to you.  And it is still fun to play the game again, even after you've solved it.  I rate most of the Nancy Drew PC games at 5 stars!

The Game itself was okay with added space combat it really adds something new and the maps from the Episode III Movie is also nice, but the bottom line is this is a clone of the first in too many areas. I was hoping you could fly from space to planets surface with more freedom. If you never owned the original you will be amazed at the gameplay, everyone else will look at it as an expansion.

What a fun game. The graphics are good. The stereo sound is awesome. There are plenty of tracks... and it's got multi-player. We've had a blast with this one. High quality fun from Nintendo.

Never having played a MMORPG (Massive Multi-player Online Role Playing Game) before, I was apprehensive at even thinking about buying this game due to the possiblity of extreme disappointment.  My friends were playing another popular game title like this one but Final Fantasy has intrigued me ever since the original console games came out for earlier systems.To say the least, this game could possibly take you forver to play!  There are so many different things to do that clear this game from the genre of simple hack-n-slash game - it's a truly in-depth world with unlimited possibilities.Graphics - 8 / 10Gameplay - 10 / 10Support - 9 / 10Onine Service - 10 / 10

There are so many different things to do that clear this game from the genre of simple hack-n-slash game - it's a truly in-depth world with unlimited possibilities.Graphics - 8 / 10Gameplay - 10 / 10Support - 9 / 10Onine Service - 10 / 10. This game is excellent.

You, as Nancy Drew, embark on a journey to discover where Jake Hurley's lost mine is. On the train, who Lori Girard's (a very rich and, uh, doesn't have a lot upstairs girl) father owns, you are accompanied with John Grey, an actor on the TV show, Ghost Hunters; Tino Balducci, a "#1" cop who just happened to be in the right place at the right time when he nabbed those criminals; Charleena Purcell, who writes romance novels; and the legendary HARDY BOYS!!Throughout the course of the mystery, you solve many puzzles. Most are easy. Then, you wait until you get to your destination: Copper Gourge. This is where Jake Hurley, the man who originally owned the train now owned by Lori's father, buried his wife, Camille, who died on the train while the couple were heading to Jake's lost mine.I recommend this Nancy Drew game, and any of the other 13 Nancy Drew mysteries, to all!

I loved going to the Arcade when I was growing up. Always enjoyed Asteroids,Donkey Kong and Pacman. Now you can relive and play these games over and over again on your tv. Playing them on a system is not quite the same,but it is still enjoyable and nice to be able to play Asteroids again.

I was buying up games for my Retron 5, but hit a snag when it came to Megaman games. They are so expensive! Megaman X-2 alone is over $100 just for a roughed up snes cart only. I bought X for Snes and 3 for Nes, but decided I needed something better without breaking the bank and no matter what between the wii and retron 5 it will be emulation. Time to dust off that Wii. I bought the Megaman Anniversary and Megmaan X Collection for the game cube. The cool thing is they have built in game saves so you don't have to type in any codes like in the old days. However, this game is not as fun on a game cube controller. There is a fix for that. If you buy the game cube classic linker adapter you can plug in a wii classic controller into the gamecube port. The wii classic controller comes close and actually has better build quality, but I wanted to play with an nes or snes controller. Onwards to adapter 2. There is this mayflash wii to nes/snes adapter. Plug in the classic linker to the game cube port, mayflash wii to nes/snes to the classic controller port on the classic linker, and then your nes/snes controller into the mayflash and boom you are all set. Playing Megman 1-8 on the good old nes controller and the snes controller on x(+). Plays great with no lag.  With sales, I was able to get all the gamecube games and adapters for under $100. Not bad when one megaman x2 game is over $100. The Nes games are over $360 for the entire collection. I already had the xbox megaman anniversary and I can promise you the gamecube editions of these Megaman games are so much better. Megaman 8 actually works on the gamecube version. You will not be disappointed. Also, if you buy the wii2hd hdmi adapter, you can even get 1080p megaman glory. I'm in old school heaven with one of the best old school game series. Also, by playing this on the good old wii, I also have access to Megaman 9 and 10 so I have all the main megaman games right at my finger tips from the same system.

The wii classic controller comes close and actually has better build quality, but I wanted to play with an nes or snes controller. Onwards to adapter 2. There is this mayflash wii to nes/snes adapter. Plug in the classic linker to the game cube port, mayflash wii to nes/snes to the classic controller port on the classic linker, and then your nes/snes controller into the mayflash and boom you are all set. Playing Megman 1-8 on the good old nes controller and the snes controller on x(+). Plays great with no lag.  With sales, I was able to get all the gamecube games and adapters for under $100. Not bad when one megaman x2 game is over $100. The Nes games are over $360 for the entire collection. I already had the xbox megaman anniversary and I can promise you the gamecube editions of these Megaman games are so much better. Megaman 8 actually works on the gamecube version. You will not be disappointed. Also, if you buy the wii2hd hdmi adapter, you can even get 1080p megaman glory. I'm in old school heaven with one of the best old school game series. Also, by playing this on the good old wii, I also have access to Megaman 9 and 10 so I have all the main megaman games right at my finger tips from the same system. This game was beautiful.
I was buying up games for my Retron 5, but hit a snag when it came to Megaman games. They are so expensive! Megaman X-2 alone is over $100 just for a roughed up snes cart only. I bought X for Snes and 3 for Nes, but decided I needed something better without breaking the bank and no matter what between the wii and retron 5 it will be emulation. Time to dust off that Wii.

I know that I'm a bit older, and somewhat new to gaming, but this was not at all what I thought it would be.  I got it loaded just fine, ran through the tutorial, and began.  How dull.  I couldn't see enough of the field to make things happen, and I grew very tired of the lame responses when I gave an order.  I did learn what I didn't like, and won't be ordering any other games like this in the future.  Experience is a great teacher.

Why game companies push away from the 2d video game for the 3d feel game is beyond me.  Most RTS games are shown from high up where you can zoom way down and control small battles or zoom out and control an army.  AoE III took away the zoom out..  You are so in the face of everything you can't really see what you are doing.  Maybe the 3d assets/textures would be too taxing on the system, but then thats a design flaw..  Anyways, decent game, but I got extremely frustrated with the camera.

Mario Kart on the Nintendo Wii is fun for the kids, but not so portable! The DS version is portable and fun. My daughter loves this game and it has enough going on to keep her interested and enjoying the game. Only a couple of items that will detract from this getting a solid 5 stars. 1. The price point for the game is very high! This is a relatively basic game with decent graphics, but compared to other mainstream games for the PC or other console game systems, the price doesn't come close to justification. Lastly, the game supports multi-player with another DS, but requires that both players have the game (other titles have multiplayer connections without requiring both parties to have the game). A limitation in my book both for price and overall functionality. It is fun, and I expect that it will be in my daughter's game library of favorites for some time. Even used versions of this game are only a fraction off the current retail price which has been north of $34 USD for some time. I'm sure that Nintendo has a business model that keeps them in business, but it would seem that a lower price point would help with higher overall volume of sales!

I'm not much of a mario kart fan, as i like to play more realistic racing titles, but this game has a special place in my heart. What do you do when you have a whole bunch of mario kart titles, a new game, and crazed fans? Combine them! -ok, maybe not the fan part, but they sure did put in a boatload of tracks from the old mario kart titles, as they did before- so nothing new. I really dont know what makes this game so darn unique.. I just fell in love with it! This game is a Blast when you get friends to play with you on other DS's. I think i love it so much because its so easy to control, and its portable, i play it everywhere i go!Bored? Too much pokemon? Tired of CoD and Halo and Battlefield? Dont like those realistic racers? Love mario? All of this equals mario kart DS. One of the best mario karts out there, my favorite one in my opinion!

I've never had a "Tycoon" game, so I thought that I'd give this game a shot.  This game turned out very good!  Through out this game, one can create his own zoo and see how it does in a simulated world.  There are bunches of worlds to build a zoo, and this game allows you to create not only exibits, but also food stands, ponds, benches, trash cans, etc.  There are many animals to exhibit along with many trees, terrain, rocks, and toys.  It is very interactive with the touch screen, and can be very addicting!Somethings I do not like, however, are the very small selection of employees (zoo keeper, tour guide, and the garbage men).  You can only keep one zoo up at a time, so if you want to create a new file, but don't want to destroy your first zoo, you are in a tight spot.Overall, I like this game, and it can become very addicting.  I would recommend it.

It's Mario Kart on the DS, plain and simple.  I kinda wish there were more tracks, but multiplayer and battle mode more than make up for it.  If you love Mario Kart you will love this game.

DreamCatcher is improving its graphics.  Ho Hum.  Maybe its me. These point and click games seem to be so difficult to get immersed in.  The game came off as stale. I don't know if it was due to the musical score (that reminded me of my grandmother's crocheted doilies on the backs and arms of sofas and chairs) or the tedious dialogue.  Maybe its the frustration of the awkward preset movements.Even though I'm not particularly interested or overtly enthusiastic about playing the early Potter games over and over, their game mechanics made playing enjoyable.Why can't we wander around freely and direct our characters in  adult adventure games?  Why are we always pointing and clicking? Why are the games stilted and lifeless? Who made that rule?Agatha Christie's novel 'And Then There Were None' kept me occupied and on the edge of my seat on a summer vacation as an awkward 13 year-old many, many, many many years ago.  I had to know 'who did it?'The game of the same name is worse than having to stay after school on a cool bright summers day.What can I say? Yuk.marf

I don't know if it was due to the musical score (that reminded me of my grandmother's crocheted doilies on the backs and arms of sofas and chairs) or the tedious dialogue.  Maybe its the frustration of the awkward preset movements.Even though I'm not particularly interested or overtly enthusiastic about playing the early Potter games over and over, their game mechanics made playing enjoyable.Why can't we wander around freely and direct our characters in  adult adventure games?  Why are we always pointing and clicking? Why are the games stilted and lifeless? Who made that rule?Agatha Christie's novel 'And Then There Were None' kept me occupied and on the edge of my seat on a summer vacation as an awkward 13 year-old many, many, many many years ago.  I had to know 'who did it?'The game of the same name is worse than having to stay after school on a cool bright summers day.What can I say? Yuk.marf. This game was perfect.

you will need a walk through for this game, everything is done on the train just about. It has a good story line, and it is a bit shorter than most of the other ND games. But even though it is shorter I didn't finish for 1 week. It is an enjoyable game.

This game is AWSOME! We have had it for a little while and it is a fantastic game! I play alot of the skirmish matches (offline) but the campain is the only thing i didnt really like about the game. It was too short and too easy. But the rest of the game is awsome! Some people reviews were talking about how realistic the game was. Some said it wasnt. Who buys a video game because of how realistic it is? Its a video game people! Its not real life! Ya its cool to see someone get blown up and fly through the air but thats not why you buy video games is it? I buy them cause i enjoy playing them and because they are unrealistic. Where else can you control a couple hundred people and take over a entire area? this game is very fun to play and i have spent some time playing this game and it is a great game. it runs smooth and it does work with windows 7 but the computer has to downgrade to make the game compatable to play.

I have to say that Sacred is one of the best action/RPG games out there.  This is my favorite genre of games to play and I own many, many hack 'n slashers like this one,(including Diablo of course) and with the exception of Divine Divinity, this is my favorite one to play.I'm sure many people will think it is sacrilige to say this game is better than Diablo II but it really comes close. Especially now that this game is super cheap ('cause it's kind of old) it is a great value.  Go out and buy this game, you won't regret it.  (I would like to finish by saying Divine Divinity is THE best action/RPG, and it's only 10 bucks!!)

...was expose me to 40K literature.  The game itself is a decent RPG, nothing great, some replay value.  But it got me started on 40K literature and nearly eight years later I am still reading 40K literature, I can't get enough.  Recommended and check out Warhammer 40K books put out by Black Library.

I was very pleased with this game. It's a very big improvement over last year. But first things first, the negatives, loading times can get a bit annoying in the caw mode but nothing too major..minor things like Christian not having the C on his tights, Mysterio doesn't have his gloves, Orton doesn't have his wrist tape are noticable but not a huge deal. The gameplay hasn't changed very much which is actually a good thing, the new stamina meter really adds alot of realism to the matches. Blood staining the mat is great also. As far as my view thats basically all the good and the bad summed up. Overall if you're going to wine about little things then you wont enjoy the game as much. But if you're a true wrestling gamer and can enjoy a game for the gameplay itself and the OVERALL presentation then this is a great buy and a great upgrade from last year.

The gameplay hasn't changed very much which is actually a good thing, the new stamina meter really adds alot of realism to the matches. Blood staining the mat is great also. As far as my view thats basically all the good and the bad summed up. Overall if you're going to wine about little things then you wont enjoy the game as much. But if you're a true wrestling gamer and can enjoy a game for the gameplay itself and the OVERALL presentation then this is a great buy and a great upgrade from last year. The game is exciting.

Certainly a game for most gamers.  It came in very good condition when received and has proven to be a very entertaining game.  It is a very unique game, and extremely fun once you get the hang of it.  While it can be strange to most outsiders, the flow of the game is very entrancing and well thoughtout.  I especially enjoyed the music for the different stages of the game.

Mario Kart DS has got to be the most overrated game on the DS. It feels like it keeps the classic Mario Kart gameplay, but very downgraded. Most of the tracks you race on (about 90%) are very boring and uninspired. These are probably the worst tracks I've ever seen on Mario Kart. The items aren't that great either, which makes the overall gameplay suck. The graphics really stink, too, they're very blocky, even for 3D DS graphics, but that's not a real problem (I shouldn't make a big deal over graphics). My biggest complaint about this game is its replay value. When I first got Mario Kart DS, I was bored after playing it for about 40 minutes. It's the only Mario Kart I didn't want to play for at least a week. Also, all the extra things in the game (mini-games, or whatever you'd call them) are less entertaining than the already lousy gameplay. Mario Kart DS overall is terrible, but I recommend playing any other Mario Kart game besides this one that you can get your hands on. Every other Mario Kart besides Mario Kart DS is worth buying. I would rate Mario Kart DS only 35 out of 100 points, due to its poor-quality gameplay, replay value, and graphics.

I've beaten the Fable 2 and it's expansion.  I've beaten the original Fable on Xbox and then beat it again with LCs.  In my opinion this game is better than the 2nd and on PC in wide screen 1080P looks gorgeous.  The armors look way better than Fable 2's.  In addition the story is better with much more fullfilling character interaction and an actual final boss fight that's worth mentioning.  This is the way to play this game.  On PC.  My only con for this game is the controls.  I wish I could use my gamepad.  Definately one of my favorite games EVER!
