Probably the quirkiest platformer ever created, Earthworm Jim is a terrifically amusing title and a classic piece of video game history. Though the game has graced many other consoles, from its counterpart on the Sega Genesis to its more recent high-definition versions on the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3, I tend to favor the SNES rendition for its comprehensive controls and admittingly, slight nostalgic value. However, if you find yourself without a Super Nintendo or Sega Genesis, I would still highly recommend this game even if it doesn't come with the added tickle of a classic controller in hand.The gameplay in Earthworm Jim is fairly straightforward, playing in a classic platformer/pseudo run-and-gun fashion. The wild and insanely bizarre worlds are filled with odd-looking and ferocious dogs, pesky birds and plenty of outlandish bosses. You will find your face stuck in a permanently confused and awkwardly giddy position the entire experience as you are constantly bombarded with one nonsensical scenario after the other. It's this peculiarity and unconventional approach that makes Earthworm Jim a unique and unmatched triumph. Get this worm before it's gone!

I love this whole series and this is the one that started it all. Earthworm Jim has a unique mix of great music, beautiful graphics, funny/awkward/creepy/insane characters and very interesting story. A game that anyone can enjoy that has a sense of humor or just enjoys a good game. this game has gotten a lot more recognition since it was rereleased on xbox live and playstation network has soared in value from 4 dollars to almost 15 dollars and climbing. get a copy before the price shoots up any higher.

If you are a longtime gamer like myself, then you were probably exposed to certain franchises like Super Mario Bros, The Legend Of Zelda, or Metroid.  But the real meat here is the Mega Man series.  One sequel and spinoff after another, Capcom drew zillions of fans to play each title for nonstop hours.I love that the Mega Man X series is included in one package.  It's Mega Man X through X3 for the Super NES, plus X4 through X6 which was originally released on the PlayStation.  And not to worry, people -- the atrocious controls that you saw on Mega Man Anniversary Collection have been corrected here.  The fire/jump buttons are EXACTLY where they are supposed to be!!I haven't beaten all 6 games yet.  However, I will briefly talk about the series.  The overall storyline has to do with Mavericks, a brand new ally named Zero, and a brand new headache by the name of Sigma.  (No Dr. Wily here, folks!)  And just like Mega Man 1 through 6, you will select 8 bosses to battle in non-linear fashion.  But that's not before starting the &#34;prologue&#34; stage and fighting a mini-boss.  So after you've creamed each robot boss, you will have to go through 4 more stages before facing that dishonorable, love-to-hate Sigma!  And yes, he is MUCH more difficult than Dr. Wily!  :)With Mega Man X4 through X6, the graphics, soundtrack and background schemes were vastly changed, thanks to the PlayStation.  And each stage is divided into 2 sections, so players certainly won't get bored anytime soon!However, what deeply saddens me is that Mega Man X7 and X8 were gravely omitted from this set.  I truly wish that the designers had included both titles -- even if that meant using a second bonus disc to cram all that content inside!  But oh well, I'll take what I can get.  It is up to me to get a PlayStation of my own if I want to burst through X7 and X8 ha ha.  Now, please be sure to check out the other Mega Man series -- Mega Man Zero, Mega Man Battle Network, Mega Man Star Force, and Mega Man ZX -- it's all too numerous to mention!

I truly wish that the designers had included both titles -- even if that meant using a second bonus disc to cram all that content inside!  But oh well, I'll take what I can get.  It is up to me to get a PlayStation of my own if I want to burst through X7 and X8 ha ha.  Now, please be sure to check out the other Mega Man series -- Mega Man Zero, Mega Man Battle Network, Mega Man Star Force, and Mega Man ZX -- it's all too numerous to mention. The game is fantastic.
If you are a longtime gamer like myself, then you were probably exposed to certain franchises like Super Mario Bros, The Legend Of Zelda, or Metroid.  But the real meat here is the Mega Man series.  One sequel and spinoff after another, Capcom drew zillions of fans to play each title for nonstop hours.I love that the Mega Man X series is included in one package.  It's Mega Man X through X3 for the Super NES, plus X4 through X6 which was originally released on the PlayStation.  And not to worry, people -- the atrocious controls that you saw on Mega Man Anniversary Collection have been corrected here.  The fire/jump buttons are EXACTLY where they are supposed to be!!I haven't beaten all 6 games yet.  However, I will briefly talk about the series.  The overall storyline has to do with Mavericks, a brand new ally named Zero, and a brand new headache by the name of Sigma.  (No Dr. Wily here, folks!)  And just like Mega Man 1 through 6, you will select 8 bosses to battle in non-linear fashion.  But that's not before starting the &#34;prologue&#34; stage and fighting a mini-boss.  So after you've creamed each robot boss, you will have to go through 4 more stages before facing that dishonorable, love-to-hate Sigma!

Do you want a true basketball simulation instead of a game where the CPU predetermines when it'll take over regardless of what team u play as and how "smart" you seem to play?  Then 2k6 is for you.  This is my first time playing 2k6...meaning I have been playing Live for a quite a while.  I bought Live 06 and took it back for a refund the next day.  Even though Live 06 has new features, they still retain major problems of 05.  Their heads are like cabbage patch dolls and all players seem to "skate" across court.Now onto 2k6.  I have never played a 2K basketball game before this so i cant really compare this to previous editions..However, as a game itself, 2k6 is the closest thing to real NBA action...the body movements, reactions, the atmosphere, and other aspects in the game are almost as accurate and precise.  Unlike Live, the players in 2k6 act like their true counterparts.  Furthermore, if u play smart and use stragety you most likely will win a ballgame(even in superstar difficulty).  AND THATS WHAT I LIKE MOST ABOUT 2K.  In Live, it didn't matter whether u played smart or not...the CPU usually took over towards the end of the game and you'd be lucky to even win by 5 points or less.

I'm going to make this short and bitter.  I rented both NBA 2K6 and Live and let me tell you... thank God that the NBA didn't sell exclusive right to EA.  Sega has made a much superior game.  The biggest flaw that I could find (I don't have online) is that the difficultly level for the computer has no inbetween.  What I mean is that its either to easy or to difficult.  I would rather get beat by the computer than blow them out but cheap loses are retarded.Rent this game to make sure that its for you... don't bother renting NBA Live it just plain sucks.

The X series are great games, unfortunately playing this classic is complicated on the cube.  The controls are awkward to the point where it is nearly unplayable and there is no option to change them.

If you liked any of the Megaman X games you'll want to pick this up. I never got to play the whole story of Megaman X, but now with this collection I can. The controls are fairly easy to use, and it really dose have the nostalgic feelings. It says there is a racing game on it but I either have to unlock it of find it some place. But in all totally worth the money.

I have always loved EA games. i have purchased every single Madden game since 97 and every nba live game since 01. With that said I see very little improvement over the years.Last year NFL 2K5 blew away Madden so i figured I would give Sega another chance. After playin NBA 2K6 I have trully become addicted. It's really sad because i skip work to play this wonderful game. However with the many pros of NBA 2k6 thier are also a few cons.Pros:wonderful graphics, Superb gameplay(realistic from the very start)Cons: Learn to use directional passing or be a ball hog because you will have a lot of tunovers otherwise.The soundtrack is horrible but you can just put the tv on mute until you start playing a game. Dunks are also not as flashy as nba live but you won't care much.The bottom line. GO GET THIS GAME NOW. STOP WHAT YOU ARE DOING AND PURCHASE THIS GAME PRONTO.IF YOU HAVE IT, GET ANOTHER ONE JUST IN CASE THE ONE YOU HAVE NOW BREAKS. THROW NBA LIVE IN THE TRASH OR TRADE IT IN FOR THIS GAME. END OF STROY!!!!!
