I've rented dozens of DS games and have purchased about 8 of them, and Mario Kart DS is, in my opinion, the best game current available for the system.The single player is robust, with many, MANY different types of play. Missions, Time Trials, racing against ghosts, Grand Prix, mirred tracks, ect..There is a spectacular amount of content in the game. The game is also very well polished. No bugs, no crashing. The menu's are very simple.It's amazing how much greatness they can squeeze into that little cart that's the size of a postage stamp.I spend a lot of time playing wireless against friends, and is definately one of the best aspects of the game. You can win by pure driving skill, just like all the other racing games, but what sets mario kart above the rest is that the items opens up a strategic element to the game that very few other racers have. You can win by using your items intelligently, or you can win by perfecting the art of cornering and power boosting. This gives the game a lot of diversity.As you progress through the game, winning races, new characters and carts and classes unlock. This keeps you motivated through the single player campaign. Once you do unlock everything, you will be very pleased with just how much content the game has.The physics and handling of the karts are just right. It is arcade style racing, but yet diverse and technical enough to reward skilled drivers. It's easy to learn, but difficult to master, and thats one of the greatest things about it.The graphics are very smooth, very colorful. The sound effects are great and give it a lot of personality and charm. The wifi play gives the game longevity. I've played a couple hundred wifi matches so far, and im ready to play hundreds more.Don't even both renting the game, just buy it, it will keep you busy for a looong time.

This is one of my favorite  NDS games. I've played 5 Mario kart games (Ds,Double Dash, Super Circuit, Wii, and 64)and this is my favorite.  The graphics are great for a Nintendo Ds game.  The best part is how many tracks are in the game. There's like 24!!!!!!!!!!  Everyone will love this game.  I usually hate racing games, but somehow this one got to be one of my favorites.  I think there's about nine characters in total.  There are so many karts to choose from.  Don't waste anytime! Buy this right away!!!!!

My favorite title for the 'touch-screened wonder' as of yet. Very addictive. Way better than the N64 Version, yet more compact. See how advanced technology can get in only about 6 years? Heres the bare-boned details: LOADS of tracks from original SNES Mario Kart, N64 Mario Kart, and They've even managed to put a few tracks from the Double Dash Mario Karts for the Gamecube! How cool is that?! More character than any of the other Mario Karts plus a few unlockable ones. (Waluigi, Drybones [skeleton Koopa Troopa] and some other one of which I haven't yet Unlocked, I think it it maybe a Black Shyguy. Anyways theres also a 'Mission Mode' where you can defeat bosses by ramming into them/Shooting items at them ETC.They've also brought back the 'Battle Mode' where you have some lives and you keep shooting items at eachother. There is an awesome 'Battle Mode' Stage where your battling ontop of a giant silver Nintendo DS and you can drive up from the bottom screen to the top by going up through the middle where the Wires are hidden and allows you to open the DS up. Lastly is Wi-FI. (Too bad I got a 56k modem ='( you need Wireless Internet to use it. If you search google though there are companies that make Wi-Fi deviced specifically for Dial-up users but playing mario karts on them would be Slower than they come.  Toodles! =') Buy this game!

Lastly is Wi-FI. (Too bad I got a 56k modem ='( you need Wireless Internet to use it. If you search google though there are companies dat make Wi-Fi deviced specifically for Dial-up users but playing mario karts on them would be Slower than they come.  Toodles! =') Buy this game!
My favorite title for the 'touch-screened wonder' as of yet. Very addictive. Way better than the N64 Version, yet more compact. See how advanced technology can get in only about 6 years? Heres the bare-boned details: LOADS of tracks from original SNES Mario Kart, N64 Mario Kart, and They've even managed to put a few tracks from the Double Dash Mario Karts for the Gamecube! How cool is that?! More character than any of the other Mario Karts plus a few unlockable ones. (Waluigi, Drybones [skeleton Koopa Troopa] and some other one of which I haven't yet Unlocked, I think there there maybe a Black Shyguy.

There was just so much that video games have made in themselves today. However much you can constantly enjoy what is now hot in arcade classics, you can never ever forget the past, and what influences have been made from it. So many classics from Pac Man to Donkey Kong and Pong still have been as dominat now, as they were back then. For Namco, they still have made that as constant as it was back in the 70's and 80's. They've made previous versions of compilations of their classics for the Game Boy, Gamecube, and Xbox to name a few. Now the Namco museum has just reissued their classic lineup yet again.Namco Museum 50th Anniversary Arcade Collection for the Nintendo Gamecube really isn't anything out of the ordinary as it was released awhile back. The game compilation features so many classics that were previously released on the Gamecube edition. This edition add on to it with a whole ordeal of extra games to match. You have some great classic games from the past including Pac Man, Xevious, which was a bonus if you have previously played Star Fox Assault, Dig Dug, and so many others just to name a few. The games have been remastered very well, without little flaws. The control and gameplay enjoyment is just as simple and enjoyable as it was released years ago from the arcades.While so many might not consider classics from the past, Namco Museum 50th Anniversary Arcade Collection really does deliver for nostalgic video game buffs. While so many would rather get a fancier game with enhanced surround sound, you can never deny those classics that are just a bite away.Graphics: B-Sound: B+Control: B+Fun & Enjoyment: B 1/2+Overall: B 1/2+

I love Mario Kart and have been a fan of the series, but this one didn't impress me as much.Sure it's fun, but the fact of the matter is in order to unlock characters and cars, you have to race 200 times on the same tracks.(There are only 8 I may add)Graphics:8/10Still the same MK graphicsSound:10/10Each track has a different tuneControls:10/10VERY easy to masterMultiplayer:10/10Unlike other MK games where you could only race on 4 tracks, you can now race on any track or do battle.Very fun.Online Play:0/10You know, when I saw that it had online play, I got all excited.I got really good at the game and then tried against others.I was REALLY disappointed at what I saw.People where hacking so that they could win in 5 seconds or using the technique "Snaking".I don't care what you want to call it, it is CHEATING.I know how to do it, but I don't see the point in doing it. It's just the race to see who can cheat faster.In the older MK's, you had to win straight up, and not with this stupid snaking stuff.Playability:Moderately-HighOverall:7.5/10Online Play kills the enjoymentMy Recommendation:If you don't like repitition, then don't buy the game.

Great game, loads of fun and you can race your friendsThis game is very similar to the classic Super Mario Kart on the Nintendo Entertainment System.  We purchased it for my Son who has really enjoyed it but I enjoyed playing it as well.  There are many different characters and vehicles to choose from.  Each vehicle has different strengths and weaknesses.  There are also different special abilities that you can pick up during gameplay and you can use them to attack your opponents.  There are five different modes to play as follows.Mission Mode: Where you are given sets of specific missions that you must clear in order to move on to the next set of missions.Grand Prix Mode: The driver who earns the most points at the end of a four-course cup is the victor. Game includes eight different cups, with each cup featuring four different tracks.Time Trial Mode: Your goal is to get the fastest time that you can on a single track.VS Mode: You can play singleplayer or multiplayer. In the singleplayer version you can race against computer-controlled karts, while in multiplayer you'll race against your friends on their own Nintendo DS systems.Battle Modes: You can pop your opponent's balloons by attacking them by colliding into them, before your own balloons are popped.

I have to be honest, i only bought this game because i wanted to try my ds online. When i first turned the game on that was the first thing i did. It was a lot of fun. Then i went to the regular gameplay, it was fun also. You cant do all the stuff online, but you can earn new cars to drive with. The only thing i have to say, is when racing online, try to race more than one person, because once they start losing they will drop out of the game causing you to lose. Even after going through ll the trouble of almost winning for the first time. Would definitely reccomend for the online play, and playing against your friends.

Instead of having $40 in the bank, I have Mario Kart. It is fun because you can unlock other tracks. It has Wi-Fi, and that is nice because you can play with other people. I got this game four months ago and  I have played with it almost every day. If your child likes to play driving-type of games, this would be perfect for your child. It can be for boys and/or girls. I have this game for the Wii and D.S. Both are pretty much the same, but the Wii has more racing tracks to play with. That is why it is more expensive. The Wii has more characters to pick from. Over all I think this game is worth the price.

Over all I think this game is worth the price.
Instead than having $40 in the bank, I have Mario Kart. It is fun because you can unlock other tracks. It has Wi-Fi, and that is nice because you can play with other people.

Do you want a true basketball simulation instead of a game where the CPU predetermines when it'll take over regardless of what team u play as and how "smart" you seem to play?  Then 2k6 is for you.  This is my first time playing 2k6...meaning I have been playing Live for a quite a while.  I bought Live 06 and took it back for a refund the next day.  Even though Live 06 has new features, they still retain major problems of 05.  Their heads are like cabbage patch dolls and all players seem to "skate" across court.Now onto 2k6.  I have never played a 2K basketball game before this so i cant really compare this to previous editions..However, as a game itself, 2k6 is the closest thing to real NBA action...the body movements, reactions, the atmosphere, and other aspects in the game are almost as accurate and precise.  Unlike Live, the players in 2k6 act like their true counterparts.  Furthermore, if u play smart and use stragety you most likely will win a ballgame(even in superstar difficulty).  AND THATS WHAT I LIKE MOST ABOUT 2K.  In Live, it didn't matter whether u played smart or not...the CPU usually took over towards the end of the game and you'd be lucky to even win by 5 points or less.

I bought this game for my 7 year old son and he absolutely loves it.  I like the fact that it has many different levels and the higher the score more levels are unlocked.  We bought this for the DS and for the Wii.  I am not very good at the game but I am getting better.

Mario Kart DS is a fun game for kids of all ages. Kids ages 6 and up will have the most success playing this game. There is a very large variety of race coarses, players, and karts. Some thing about this game can get frustrating, especially when you have to do Missions to unlock items and help win the game. The Missions (the last several) are tricky, despite the fact I am an experienced player. Overall the graphics are great and fun. I love this game.

If you are a longtime gamer like myself, then you were probably exposed to certain franchises like Super Mario Bros, The Legend Of Zelda, or Metroid.  But the real meat here is the Mega Man series.  One sequel and spinoff after another, Capcom drew zillions of fans to play each title for nonstop hours.I love that the Mega Man X series is included in one package.  It's Mega Man X through X3 for the Super NES, plus X4 through X6 which was originally released on the PlayStation.  And not to worry, people -- the atrocious controls that you saw on Mega Man Anniversary Collection have been corrected here.  The fire/jump buttons are EXACTLY where they are supposed to be!!I haven't beaten all 6 games yet.  However, I will briefly talk about the series.  The overall storyline has to do with Mavericks, a brand new ally named Zero, and a brand new headache by the name of Sigma.  (No Dr. Wily here, folks!)  And just like Mega Man 1 through 6, you will select 8 bosses to battle in non-linear fashion.  But that's not before starting the &#34;prologue&#34; stage and fighting a mini-boss.  So after you've creamed each robot boss, you will have to go through 4 more stages before facing that dishonorable, love-to-hate Sigma!  And yes, he is MUCH more difficult than Dr. Wily!  :)With Mega Man X4 through X6, the graphics, soundtrack and background schemes were vastly changed, thanks to the PlayStation.  And each stage is divided into 2 sections, so players certainly won't get bored anytime soon!However, what deeply saddens me is that Mega Man X7 and X8 were gravely omitted from this set.  I truly wish that the designers had included both titles -- even if that meant using a second bonus disc to cram all that content inside!  But oh well, I'll take what I can get.  It is up to me to get a PlayStation of my own if I want to burst through X7 and X8 ha ha.  Now, please be sure to check out the other Mega Man series -- Mega Man Zero, Mega Man Battle Network, Mega Man Star Force, and Mega Man ZX -- it's all too numerous to mention!

It's Mega Man X through X3 for the Super NES, plus X4 through X6 which was originally released on the PlayStation.  And not to worry, people -- the atrocious controls that you saw on Mega Man Anniversary Collection have been corrected here.  The fire/jump buttons are EXACTLY where they are supposed to be!!I haven't beaten all 6 games yet.  However, I will briefly talk about the series.  The overall storyline has to do with Mavericks, a brand new ally named Zero, and a brand new headache by the name of Sigma.  (No Dr. Wily here, folks!)  And just like Mega Man 1 through 6, you will select 8 bosses to battle in non-linear fashion.  But that's not before starting the &#34;prologue&#34; stage and fighting a mini-boss.  So after you've creamed each robot boss, you will have to go through 4 more stages before facing that dishonorable, love-to-hate Sigma!  And yes, he is MUCH more difficult than Dr. Wily!  :)With Mega Man X4 through X6, the graphics, soundtrack and background schemes were vastly changed, thanks to the PlayStation.  And each stage is divided into 2 sections, so players certainly won't get bored anytime soon!However, what deeply saddens me is that Mega Man X7 and X8 were gravely omitted from each set.  I truly wish that the designers had included both titles -- even if that meant using a second bonus disc to cram all that content inside!  But oh well, I'll take what I can get.  It is up to me to get a PlayStation of my own if I want to burst through X7 and X8 ha ha.  Now, please be sure to check out the other Mega Man series -- Mega Man Zero, Mega Man Battle Network, Mega Man Star Force, and Mega Man ZX -- it's all too numerous to mention!

I just received my copy of Namco Museum 50th Anniversary for the GC a few days ago. Believe me, if you were around the arcades in CA. like Golfland, Games & Things, and many others, it was a place where you could leave all your troubles behind. My all-time favorites are Ms Pacman, Pacman, Super Pacman, Jr. Pacman, Pacman Plus, Galaxian, Galaga 88, Dig Dug, and many others.The main reason I bought Namco Museum 50th Anniversary for the GC is that I could play all my favorite games of the 80's anytime I want. In the future, I'm hoping that Namco will bring Super Pacman, Pacman Plus, and Junior Pacman to the NamcoMuseum Series. To me, the graphics don't mean a whole lot. They're simple and the only thing that matters is the fun you get out of palying them.You get 14 games, that is reason enough to fork over $19.99 for this game. Plus, there are 2 unlockable games(Galaga 88 & Pac Mania!). There are some games on this disc I never played before. Games like Sky Kid and Dragon Spirit, but Itried them and enjoyed them as well. If you own anyof the systems, be it GC, PS2, or X-Box, you can'tgo wrong with Namco Museum 50th Anniversary. Loadsof fun for your money.

I'm not much of a mario kart fan, as i like to play more realistic racing titles, but this game has a special place in my heart. What do you do when you have a whole bunch of mario kart titles, a new game, and crazed fans? Combine them! -ok, maybe not the fan part, but they sure did put in a boatload of tracks from the old mario kart titles, as they did before- so nothing new. I really dont know what makes this game so darn unique.. I just fell in love with it! This game is a Blast when you get friends to play with you on other DS's. I think i love it so much because its so easy to control, and its portable, i play it everywhere i go!Bored? Too much pokemon? Tired of CoD and Halo and Battlefield? Dont like those realistic racers? Love mario? All of this equals mario kart DS. One of the best mario karts out there, my favorite one in my opinion!

Dont like those realistic racers? Love mario? All of this equals mario kart DS. One of the best mario karts out there, my favorite one in my opinion!
I'm not much of a mario kart fan, as i like to play more realistic racing titles, but this game has a special place in my heart. What do you do when you have a whole bunch of mario kart titles, a new game, and crazed fans? Combine them! -ok, maybe not the fan part, but they sure did put in a boatload of tracks from the old mario kart titles, as they did before- so nothing new.

All of the Mario Kart games are fun to play but Mario Kart DS is my favorite because it has some of the coolest levels in the series. In addition to the old school style levels there are new ones to the Mario Kart series like Luigi's Mansion and Tick Tock Clock.The graphics are really smooth and better than most of the other games in the series and the game is a lot of fun. The only thing that would make it even better than it is would be if you could play the game on a tv.

I don't want to think about how many hundreds of dollars I've spent on video games over the years for my son, but I have no complaints about this one- it has been the best of ALL. He's had it for YEARS now and it's still one of his all time favorites. It's not the type that he plays, conquers all the levels in a week and then never looks at again. Nor is it the type where he gets stuck on a level and it just becomes frustrating. It's a game that seems to be fun time after time after time. This is also a game you can play with another DS even if they don't have the game, which is SUPER fun. Sometimes I'll have up to 4 boys in the back of the car playing Mario Kart and having a blast while we're driving somewhere. Great game.

My son and I started playing Mario Kart on the Game Boy and had hours of fun doing battles and races. When it went to the DS, he was thrilled and again when it went to the Wii. He eventually sold his DS version of Mario Kart to get enough money to buy Minecraft. But he missed it terribly. So when given the chance, he ended up buying it again and has had a ton of fun playin it all over. It's portable, fun and as challenging as you want to make it.A classic Nintendo game for any racing enthusiast.

As someone who's time is more Atari 2600 and the original NES I have to say I absolutely loved this game!  As someone who has completed the original Mariokart, Gamecube and Wii version I have truly loved playing through this one.... if you play the wii one you will be well prepared for this game... maily that the speed of this is much slower than the Wii, and someone like me can really appreciate that, I think games move much to fast today and only recently did I start gettting back in to video games for that main reason...  If you have a DS, this is a must have!!  Trust me, even though it doesn't move as fast as home console versions, it is still a true challange, I only beat it as quick as I did b/c I played it as much as I could for 2 weeks... oh, and the missions in this are quite fun also... different, but fun!

Trust me, even though it doesn't move as fast as home console versions, it is still a true challange, I only beat it as quick as I did b/c I played it as much as I could for 2 weeks... oh, and the missions over this are quite fun also... different, but fun!
As someone who's time is more Atari 2600 and the original NES I have to say I absolutely loved this game!

I was buying up games for my Retron 5, but hit a snag when it came to Megaman games. They are so expensive! Megaman X-2 alone is over $100 just for a roughed up snes cart only. I bought X for Snes and 3 for Nes, but decided I needed something better without breaking the bank and no matter what between the wii and retron 5 it will be emulation. Time to dust off that Wii. I bought the Megaman Anniversary and Megmaan X Collection for the game cube. The cool thing is they have built in game saves so you don't have to type in any codes like in the old days. However, this game is not as fun on a game cube controller. There is a fix for that. If you buy the game cube classic linker adapter you can plug in a wii classic controller into the gamecube port. The wii classic controller comes close and actually has better build quality, but I wanted to play with an nes or snes controller. Onwards to adapter 2. There is this mayflash wii to nes/snes adapter. Plug in the classic linker to the game cube port, mayflash wii to nes/snes to the classic controller port on the classic linker, and then your nes/snes controller into the mayflash and boom you are all set. Playing Megman 1-8 on the good old nes controller and the snes controller on x(+). Plays great with no lag.  With sales, I was able to get all the gamecube games and adapters for under $100. Not bad when one megaman x2 game is over $100. The Nes games are over $360 for the entire collection. I already had the xbox megaman anniversary and I can promise you the gamecube editions of these Megaman games are so much better. Megaman 8 actually works on the gamecube version. You will not be disappointed. Also, if you buy the wii2hd hdmi adapter, you can even get 1080p megaman glory. I'm in old school heaven with one of the best old school game series. Also, by playing this on the good old wii, I also have access to Megaman 9 and 10 so I have all the main megaman games right at my finger tips from the same system.

I bought X for Snes and 3 for Nes, but decided I needed something better without breaking the bank and no matter what between the wii and retron 5 it will be emulation. Time to dust off that Wii. I bought the Megaman Anniversary and Megmaan X Collection for the game cube. The cool thing is they have built in game saves so you don't have to type in any codes like in the old days. However, this game is not as fun on a game cube controller. There is a fix for that. If you buy the game cube classic linker adapter you can plug in a wii classic controller into the gamecube port. The wii classic controller comes close and actually has better build quality, but I wanted to play with an nes or snes controller. Onwards to adapter 2. There is this mayflash wii to nes/snes adapter. Plug in the classic linker to the game cube port, mayflash wii to nes/snes to the classic controller port on the classic linker, and then your nes/snes controller into the mayflash and boom you are all set. Playing Megman 1-8 on the good old nes controller and the snes controller on x(+). Plays great with no lag.  With sales, I was able to grab all the gamecube games and adapters for under $100. Not bad when one megaman x2 game is over $100. The Nes games are over $360 for the entire collection. I already had the xbox megaman anniversary and I can promise you the gamecube editions of these Megaman games are so much better. Megaman 8 actually works on the gamecube version. You will not be disappointed. Also, if you buy the wii2hd hdmi adapter, you can even grab 1080p megaman glory. I'm in old school heaven with one of the best old school game series.

I got this game for my ''I LOVE MARIO CHARCTERS'' child. She would not stop playing it. She said'' daddy,watch this.It is awesome!'' So, I  watched her. It had really good animations. She kept playing for the day, nearly. She finally said something. It looked really fun. She always plays Yoshi.  When my mom got this for my daughter for christmas , I thought " oh brother!" Then, I saw she really liked it. She is a addicts, espically that day.I wanted to bring it back because it was almost 40.00! My mom usally does this stuff. But,luckily is was a game she liked. So, It was a F.U.N game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

At first, this is a really fun game but my big problem with it is it's WAY TOO EASY.  Even on the hard settings, I had no problem. After you unlock everything, it gets very boring and I don't play it now.  It would be really good if it had a really hard level or more tracks to race on.  It was fun while it lasted but it's just not challenging enough.

If you like the classic Mario Kart for SNES or N64 then surely you cannot pass up this title.  Though the mechanics are a little different with the DS hardware, the game is engaging and fun nonetheless.  The wi-fi multiplayer is a lot of fun too... you just have to convince your DS buddies to buy a copy.

Out of all of the mariokarts that have been released....this is easily the best one.  Not only because it is portable, but everything from the characters, the handling, the track design (which includes several from past games as well), the battle mode, the online play, are near perfect.One of the DS screens acts as the main view for your cart, and the other is a map, which sounds like an easy out for the touch screen, but is actually quite helpful when trying to see where your opponents are, and what weapons they carry.The only bad things i can think of for this game, are whenever you are in the lead (by a large margin) the computer ALWAYS gets the blue shell to knock you on your keister.  I swear i've been hit with a blue shell three times in as many minutes.  Also, some of the level design in the battle mode are a bit....basic.  but overall, I can't give this game enough praise.  I've had it since it launched, and still play it to this day.

The only other Mariokart I've played is the one for the 64, but I got hooked on that fast--and this one's even better! You start with only four available  races in three different difficulty levels, but each time you win you unlock new racetracks, characters, and karts, which keeps you hooked, wanting to see what comes next.  If you love mario OR racing, you'll love this game. The only downside is its replay value--once you've unlocked all the characters and carts, it gets a little boring since you have nothing to do but try to beat your top scores. But even then it's still fun to pick up here and there when you have ten minutes to kill.It's great fun to play against other people who have the game too. I've only tried this feature a couple times but it's great!

I have always loved EA games. i have purchased every single Madden game since 97 and every nba live game since 01. With that said I see very little improvement over the years.Last year NFL 2K5 blew away Madden so i figured I would give Sega another chance. After playin NBA 2K6 I have trully become addicted. It's really sad because i skip work to play this wonderful game. However with the many pros of NBA 2k6 thier are also a few cons.Pros:wonderful graphics, Superb gameplay(realistic from the very start)Cons: Learn to use directional passing or be a ball hog because you will have a lot of tunovers otherwise.The soundtrack is horrible but you can just put the tv on mute until you start playing a game. Dunks are also not as flashy as nba live but you won't care much.The bottom line. GO GET THIS GAME NOW. STOP WHAT YOU ARE DOING AND PURCHASE THIS GAME PRONTO.IF YOU HAVE IT, GET ANOTHER ONE JUST IN CASE THE ONE YOU HAVE NOW BREAKS. THROW NBA LIVE IN THE TRASH OR TRADE IT IN FOR THIS GAME. END OF STROY!!!!!

With that said I see very little improvement over the years.Last year NFL 2K5 blew away Madden so i figured I would give Sega another chance. After playin NBA 2K6 I have trully become addicted. It's really sad because i skip work to play this wonderful game. However with the many pros for NBA 2k6 thier are also a few cons.Pros:wonderful graphics, Superb gameplay(realistic from the very start)Cons: Learn to use directional passing or be a ball hog because you will have a lot for tunovers otherwise.The soundtrack is horrible but you can just put the tv on mute until you start playing a game. Dunks are also not as flashy as nba live but you won't care much.The bottom line. GO GET THIS GAME NOW. STOP WHAT YOU ARE DOING AND PURCHASE THIS GAME PRONTO.IF YOU HAVE IT, GET ANOTHER ONE JUST IN CASE THE ONE YOU HAVE NOW BREAKS. THROW NBA LIVE IN THE TRASH OR TRADE IT IN FOR THIS GAME. END OF STROY!!!!!

My personal opinion is that the N64 Mario Kart was the apex of the series (until now). Double Dash had much better graphics but was a letdown in so many ways. First they got rid of my all time favorite weapon, the triple shells. Jumping was removed and the battle mode arenas were simply awful. My favorite part of battle mode was sending shells off the second or third tier and letting them bounce around like crazy to my opponents' dismay. Nintendo removed multi-tier arenas and made shells shatter after one bounce. It was as if Nintendo researched exactly what it was about Mario Kart that I loved... and removed it.With the DS version of Mario Kart all is forgiven. Triple shells and jumps are back and the battle mode arenas are vastly improved. I also discovered that the directional pad controls just as well as the analog stick and power slides are a breeze to pull off. There are 32 unique tracks with 16 retro tracks and 16 brand new. The retro tracks are taken from the four previous version of MK including NES, N64, GCN and GBA. Most tracks are completed overhauled and upgraded for the power of the DS while the GCN tracks are reduced somewhat. The all new tracks are terrific with a lot more moving environments than in older MK tracks. There are a few new weapons, the most unique being a blooper that sprays ink on the screen to obscure the drivers view. Although the touch screen is unused the map on the second screen is a tremendous help for a lot of different reasons.The biggest addition to the game is internet connectivity which I haven't had a chance to try out. The other addition is a series of missions that actually add little to the game except for perhaps honing your driving skills. Players can also play battle mode against Bots if that's what you want to do. It's really not too much fun without a human opponent.Mario Kart was pushed back nearly a year and the extra time shows in the quality of the product. This is a well polished piece of software that delivers a stellar Kart experience. If you're reading reviews to decide whether the game is worth it STOP and get the game. You're only wasting valuable playtime. Now I just need to find some free WiFi hotspots.

My personal opinion is that the N64 Mario Kart was the apex of the series (until now). Double Dash had much better graphics but was a letdown in so many ways. First they got rid of my all time favorite weapon, the triple shells. Jumping was removed and the battle mode arenas were simply awful. My favorite part of battle mode was sending shells off the second or third tier and letting them bounce around like crazy to my opponents' dismay. Nintendo removed multi-tier arenas and made shells shatter after one bounce. It was as if Nintendo researched exactly what it was about Mario Kart that I loved... and removed it.With the DS version of Mario Kart all is forgiven. Triple shells and jumps are back and the battle mode arenas are vastly improved. I also discovered that the directional pad controls just as well as the analog stick and power slides are a breeze to pull off. There are 32 unique tracks plus 16 retro tracks and 16 brand new. The retro tracks are taken from the four previous version of MK including NES, N64, GCN and GBA. Most tracks are completed overhauled and upgraded for the power of the DS while the GCN tracks are reduced somewhat. The all new tracks are terrific plus a lot more moving environments than in older MK tracks. There are a few new weapons, the most unique being a blooper that sprays ink on the screen to obscure the drivers view. Although the touch screen is unused the map on the second screen is a tremendous help for a lot of different reasons.The biggest addition to the game is internet connectivity which I haven't had a chance to try out. The other addition is a series of missions that actually add little to the game except for perhaps honing your driving skills. Players can also play battle mode against Bots if that's what you want to do. It's really not too much fun without a human opponent.Mario Kart was pushed back nearly a year and the extra time shows in the quality of the product.

I never bought the Mega Man games (original or X series) back in the day because I never considered my gaming skills good enough to get through them. But now its a decade later, and seeing as how Capcom has been nice enough to bring these classics together, I thought I'd give it a shot.The good news is that my gaming skills have indeed improved, and I'm tearing through the games in this collection at a moderately strong pace. You get the first six Mega Man X games here, and also an unlockable bonus which is essentially a Mario Kart clone. Mega Man is the quintessential action platformer, with carefully timed jumps and boss attack patterns and weaknesses that need to be discovered. Generally I liked the first three SNES installments the best (X3 actually has the anime cutscenes from the Playstation port). As the series got older it started injecting more "story" into the cutscenes and taking itself too seriously. Plus when you recycle a formula so many times, the flash tends to overtake the substance. But as a whole, there's a lot of game to experience here.If you're in the mood for retro 2D gaming this is a great buy. I don't know if I would've paid sticker price for all of these games individually, but together at this low cost you can't go wrong.

Seriously though...This is hands down my favorite Mario Kart game to date.  Everything from the graphics to the gameplay is just perfect.  The primary reason why it's my favorite game in the franchise is the sheer wealth of tracks.  There are eight cups in the game with four tracks each, bringing it to the grand total of 32 courses.  16 of these tracks are retro tracks from earlier incarnations of the game (SNES, N64, Gameboy Advance, and Gamecube).  This game has the most tracks featured in a single Mario Kart game ever.I've only tried the online play a couple of times.  Many of the players online use a method called "snaking" where they set off several consecutive mini-turbos while drifting back and forth across a straightaway.  I pretty much got stomped most of the time.  I'm not into the whole snaking idea, so I choose not to spend time learning how to do it well.  However the Wireless LAN play is a blast.  I'm sure this is going to keep my friends and I occupied for quite a while.If you own a DS, this is a must-have.

Everyone has a favorite game in any genre. For me, in the action/adventure department, these 6 excellent games are my absolute favorites. No matter how many times I have beaten the games, I come back for more. I still remember playing the first X game for the SNES, I literally hogged my friend's SNES (sadly I didn't have one and my parents didn't let me have one). Then when X4 came out (not much to explain about X2 and X3 since they have similar gameplay), I beat the game so many times that I eventually got bored with it, which took a few years. X5 and X6, the last 2 great ones, were great but starting to make the future X games fall apart. The sad thing is that because 2D gameplay is pretty much extinct, some game series just aren't the same in 3D (mainly the later X games and other non-Capcom games like Castlevania, however there are some I like, Megaman Legends, Street Fighter EX plus alpha, The Mortal Kombat games (non fighting ones make me sick)) and people just want more realistic games. because of this once the 128 bit era ends, I am not getting anymore future systems. anyway, for those who love Mega Man get this collection. for those who like Mega Man but didn't like the X series look else where and for those who either don't like Mega Man or don't like 2D gameplay do the same thing, but it's just sad with the fact that some of these games' stuff have made other games us that specific option (for instance I think that when X3 came out, which had that map screen before you start the level, was later used in some non-Mega Man and Capcom games like Castlevania Symphony of the Night when it came to looking at the map of the huge castle.) Also, sometimes not all 3D gameplay isn't great. It made some game series more improved but some of them failed and the series was never seen in public again (Earthworm Jim and Bubsy 3D to be specific).

The sad thing is that because 2D gameplay is pretty much extinct, some game series just aren't the same in 3D (mainly the later X games and other non-Capcom games like Castlevania, however there are some I like, Megaman Legends, Street Fighter EX plus alpha, The Mortal Kombat games (non fighting ones make me sick)) and people just want more realistic games. because of this once the 128 bit era ends, I am not getting anymore future systems. anyway, for those who love Mega Man get this collection. for those who like Mega Man but didn't like the X series look else where and for those who either don't like Mega Man or don't like 2D gameplay do the same thing, but it's just sad by the fact that some of these games' stuff have made other games us that specific option (for instance I think that when X3 came out, which had that map screen before you start the level, was later used in some non-Mega Man and Capcom games like Castlevania Symphony of the Night when it came to looking at the map of the huge castle.) Also, sometimes not all 3D gameplay isn't great. It made some game series more improved but some of them failed and the series was never seen in public again (Earthworm Jim and Bubsy 3D to be specific).
Everyone has a favorite game in any genre. For me, in the action/adventure department, these 6 excellent games are my absolute favorites. No matter how many times I have beaten the games, I come back for more. I still remember playing the first X game for the SNES, I literally hogged my friend's SNES (sadly I didn't have one and my parents didn't let me have one).

Difficulty:Just RightTime Spent:40 to 100 HoursThe Bottom Line:"Great multiplayer"This game features characters like Peach, Mario, Luigi, Bowser, Toad, Wario and Yoshi and hidden characters such as Waluigi, Dry Bones, R.O.B. and Daisy. Each character has their own stats, strengths and weaknesses. For beginners I'd recommend Toad or Mario.The levels are fun and the multiplayer is even funner. The game's strengths are that you can come back and come back for more and it doesn't get boring and tried and true for a while. Also, the graphics are pleasant while pushing no boundaries.Levels are your typical Mario Kart affair but many boards from past games return which was fun to see (especially Frappe Snowland and Moo Moo Farm).You can play with others that are local or you can rev up the game online through Wi-Fi with people from the states or from all over the world which was neat (but sometimes takes a while).There are also one player mini games that you can excel at called Missions.

Sure, any company could put some wannabe mastcot in a kart and say this is a bangin' game. But Mario Kart is the undisputed champ of the genre, cause of the super smooth controls, inovative tracks, and 'zangy' powerups that'll addict even the most hardcore gamers.Sure, it's a little bit of a repeat of the other Mario kart games that have Mario's buddies tossing shells, and using mushrooms on rainbow colored coures, but you'll be challenged be the compitition just like you were in Grand Turismo.You get put into sixteen totally fresh tracks and replay some of the great ones like Rainbow Road, and Bowser's Castle. Don't worry, we still have the always fabulous battle-modes, and of course, it's Wi-Fi if you want to be challenged.Online matches only have one flaw, you have to accept you aren't the best Mario Kart player in the whole world. And if you are the best player in the world, you can't brag about it to your online buddies, there's no voice chat!Another flaw is a personal one of mine, there aren't any analog sticks, and no power slidin' which I love so much from Double Dash. But you won't find a better hand-held racing game that can claim that they're tops over Mario Kart DS!

But Mario Kart is the undisputed champ of the genre, cause of the super smooth controls, inovative tracks, and 'zangy' powerups that'll addict even the most hardcore gamers.Sure, it's a little bit of a repeat of the other Mario kart games that have Mario's buddies tossing shells, and using mushrooms on rainbow colored coures, but you'll be challenged be the compitition just like you were in Grand Turismo.You get put into sixteen totally fresh tracks and replay some of the great ones like Rainbow Road, and Bowser's Castle. Don't worry, we still have the always fabulous battle-modes, and of course, it's Wi-Fi if you want to be challenged.Online matches only have one flaw, you have to accept you aren't the best Mario Kart player in the whole world. And if you are the best player in the world, you can't brag about it to your online buddies, there's no voice chat!Another flaw is a personal one of mine, there aren't any analog sticks, and no power slidin' which I love so much on Double Dash. But you won't find a better hand-held racing game that can claim that they're tops over Mario Kart DS!

If you've read any of my other reviews on DS games, you might have heard me say this before....One thing I'll have to hand to Nintendo, even though they might not have alot in quantity of games for the Nintendo DS, what games that are released for the system are of good quality. Not once have I bought a game that wasn't fun, addictive or deep in gameplay. Sadly, I hate to admit, I can't say that with the Playstation Portable. Sure, some games were flawed(course, all games have flaws of some sort). And, sure, the graphics aren't of PSP calibur but who really cares when the games are this good. Take Mario Kart DS, for instance...it took awhile to come out but it was well worth the wait. With over 30 courses drawn from every Mario Kart game -Super Mario Kart, Mario Kart 64, Mario Kart: Super Circuit, and Mario Kart: Double Dash, Mario Kart DS is a game that's not to be missed. The all-star cast includes characters you all know and love like..Mario, Luigi, Peach, Yoshi, Konkey Kong, Wario, Bowser,and Toad.  The game also allows up to eight players to play with only one copy. The best thing about the game is the Wi-Fi gameplay. I'm surprised with its' more ambitious gameplay. I don't have any gripes with this game in any way.I simply adored Mario Kart: Super Circuit for the Gameboy Advance. It was an absolute blast to play through. Mario Kart DS is no different. Keeping with the tried and true Mario Kart formula, Mario Kart DS will surely please Mario Kart and Racing fans alike.

I traded in some games and got this. First off, this game is VERY challenging. Second is that it is up to 8 players using only 1 card! You may think you won just because you got 1'st, but they also grade your driving skill. If you like fun games, get this game!

Ok so here is how this game breaks down. Time and time again I am having these babble ridden reviews shoved down my throat and it is time to chime in.This game was built for the online community, end of story. Being a long time veteran of online multiplayer games such as MOHAA, D2, HALO etc.. etc... Two of which I have built and been members of clans, owned servers, PWNT ALL. I can honestly say that this is a top notch multiplayer game, I say again for the mentally challenged... MULTIPLAYER!!! The single player story is weak at best, it looks great but it is weak I will grant everyone that. However, launch that multiplayer game, join a server, spark up that double sided saber, get into a one on one with another live player and the adrenaline does flow... Use the speed force and or the pull push force, any of the three detonators they give you or a multitude of blasters just for fun and you cannot go wrong.For those familiar with online gameplay, you know that pings are important. In MOHAA, if you have a ping of 180, you have the worst possible response time and most likely end up on your face dead before you've even see the enemy..... And this is with graphics set to minimum. With JA, your ping can be 180 and the gameply is still seamless even with all the graphics, colors and action. Very few interruptions in gameplay which is also refreshing.Overall:Gameplay=GreatGraphics=GreatSingle Plyaer=WeakMultiplayer=GreatSound=GreatCharater Mods=WeakIf you like multiplayer? I highley recommend it. If you are a single player noob that only enjoys playing with yourself? Look elsewhere... Might I suggest that sing along barbie game?

Star Wars Jedi Academy is a lot of fun.  I found myself unable to turn off my computer until I finished playing it.  I completed Jedi Academy in a little over a week, playing about 2 hours per day on the average.  I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes Star Wars.  There is nothing like wielding a lightsaber and fighting dark jedi.  I found that I rarely used the first person mode with a gun/blaster.  The lightsaber was too much fun!!

It's Mario Kart on the DS, plain and simple.  I kinda wish there were more tracks, but multiplayer and battle mode more than make up for it.  If you love Mario Kart you will love this game.

I'm going to make this short and bitter.  I rented both NBA 2K6 and Live and let me tell you... thank God that the NBA didn't sell exclusive right to EA.  Sega has made a much superior game.  The biggest flaw that I could find (I don't have online) is that the difficultly level for the computer has no inbetween.  What I mean is that its either to easy or to difficult.  I would rather get beat by the computer than blow them out but cheap loses are retarded.Rent this game to make sure that its for you... don't bother renting NBA Live it just plain sucks.

I loved Mario Kart when it first came out on the SNES in the early 90s. I found the DS version to be just as fun - and far more portable!You get both the classic racetracks plus a few new ones. You get a variety of kart sizes and styles. Go for the small, super fast kart, or maybe opt for the larger, heavier one. It all depends on your gameplay style.In addition to the fun single player games, the DS wi-fi maeks it very easy to play online with up to 8 players! If you thought Mario Kart was fun zipping around against AI, you should try it against a few of your friends.If you want a bit of thinking, there are a variety of missions that you can take on. You can gather coins, try to beat time limits, and so on.I really appreciated that they didn't "touch screen" this to death. A lot of games brought to the DS go insane with touch screen features which make the game much harder to play. With Mario Kart, they use the lower screen for map information, which is really useful if you need it, but is nicely out of the way if you don't. It's the best of both worlds.What's really great about this game is that all ages love it. It's a game that grandparents can play with their grandkids for hours and hours and really have fun doing it.Highly recommended!

The Mario Kart franchise is one of the most popular and sold gaming franchises every made.  And there is a reason for that.  Because the game is just a total blast to play.  And this Mario Kart DS game is no exception.  The game is truly fun to play.  Yes newer more recent games have been released which I am sure are much better than this one.  But if you would like to save a little money and want to experience all the rage about Mario Kart, this would be a fantastic start.

I remember playing "Mario Kart 64" once with a neighbor's kids years ago.  Not a big fan of racing games then, I had a lot fun with this game (especially with the Battle Mode) and I've been itching for a chance to experience the fun again.  Now I can, any place, any time, thanks to "Mario Kart DS."Still the undisputed king of handheld racing after its 2005 launch, "MKDS" seems to take the best of every game in the "Mario Kart" series and squeezes it all into that little game card, and sticking that nice label on it.  Starting in Grand Prix mode, you choose from 3 engine classes, 8 racers, 2 karts, and 4 cups with 4 courses each.  And then you're off!  There are more cups, karts and racers hidden in the game but with no cheat codes to speak of, you'll just have to do things the old fashioned way.  A map is provided on the touch screen in case you steer off course.While a great gaming experience, you can only have so fun just racing while unlocking stuff.  Fortunately, there's so much more to do in "MKDS."  Aside from racing other players wirelessly or online, you can also enter an improved Battle mode with new arenas, including an old-school Nintendo DS.  And then there's yet another mode that has you take on different "missions" to unlock more missions.  To sum it all up, deciding whether or not this is a quality racing game for your DS, it's a no-brainer.This game is rated E for Everyone: Mild Violence.

Sure I've heard of Mario but didn't know a thing about the game. That was until I played it on wii at a friends house and found out if was a blast.I had to search out and wait for a sale or used one and it paid off I found one. What fun it is. Not quite the same as wii of course but still very much fun and I am much better at staying on the track on this one but still not winning very many races.Practice makes perfect. I was also recommended this by another adult DS player who read my Listmania and responded I needed this and one more game to round out my adult collection. She was right. Now I just have to sell a game as I have a rule one comes in one goes out. Guess I had better hurry and solve Professor Layton and the curious villiage. Who knew that one would be so hard. Yikes I've logged 10 hours not all at once and seem to be getting no where. Oh well different story.Get Mario Kart it is tons of fun.

I was also recommended this by another adult DS player who read the Listmania and responded I needed this and one more game to round out the adult collection. She was right. Now I just have to sell a game as I have a rule one comes in one goes out. Guess I had better hurry and solve Professor Layton and the curious villiage. Who knew that one would be so hard. Yikes I've logged 10 hours not all at once and seem to be getting no where. Oh well different story.Get Mario Kart it is tons of fun.

The Good: Fast lightsaber action, FPS and TPS views are easy to switch too, great use of the Force powers, decent graphics, Twi'leks are hotThe Bad: Combat requires too much precision, dumb as dirt AI, mundane voice acting, toss away story, difficult level design, not very useful training levelI remember back when this game came out it was a huge thing. Everyone had it and everyone played it. I, in fact, didn't because I had a really crappy computer at the time. Now 4 years later I get a hold of it and I realize how great it was...for the time. The game is loads of fun and the lightsaber combat is fun, quick and easy to use but the game shows its age early on and it's old fast. While you can also use weapons and go into a FPS view this is all to a fault. The lightsaber actions requires too much precision and the the weapons don't seem to ever do enough damage no matter how powerful it is.The enemy AI is dumb as dirt while they stand there and blast you or kamikaze it and run into your lightsaber or line of fire. You can power up your Force powers which takes forever since there's so many slots and you only get one upgrade point for ever mission you complete. The missions can sometimes leave you wondering what to do or where to go due to the lack of an arrow or map.The graphics are actually pretty nice even for today and you can customize your character...but it's bare bones. The best feature is the online multiplayer but even that is faulted due to the games age. If you want some good `ol Star Wars fun pick this up and you won't regret it.

for $35, this game provides many hours of entertainment.  you can go wrong!  once you win gold trophies for all 4 cups, then you get a mirror class that will allow you to play all 32 race courses as the mirror mode.  you can even play with other people via WiFi, although I haven't tried that.  There are race courses that let you race inside a pinball machine and inside of a clock.  There are total of 32 race courses in this game.  plus the mirror mode, you get 64 race courses.  the price you pay, it is like fifty cents per race course.  what a bargain.pros: nice stereo surround sound.  nice graphics.  new weapons.  can play the "retro" SNES, N64, GameCube courses.cons: play the game intensely with eyes about a foot away from the screen can strain the eyes.  the graphics sometimes can be a bit pixelated.  the "A" button and the "X" button a bit hard to press simultaneously.If Nintendo publishes a Mario Kart DS Track II, then it will be one more purchase I make on Amazon.

This game is overall very good. You have a numerous amount of force power and a surprising amount of weapons. The only bad things about this game is that sometimes you are fight, you slice a dude with your lightsaber and you hit his waist, his body doesn't go in half or anything fun like that lol. This game is very addicting and fun they should even make a sequel to this game because of the different ending.

Probably the quirkiest platformer ever created, Earthworm Jim is a terrifically amusing title and a classic piece of video game history. Though the game has graced many other consoles, from its counterpart on the Sega Genesis to its more recent high-definition versions on the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3, I tend to favor the SNES rendition for its comprehensive controls and admittingly, slight nostalgic value. However, if you find yourself without a Super Nintendo or Sega Genesis, I would still highly recommend this game even if it doesn't come with the added tickle of a classic controller in hand.The gameplay in Earthworm Jim is fairly straightforward, playing in a classic platformer/pseudo run-and-gun fashion. The wild and insanely bizarre worlds are filled with odd-looking and ferocious dogs, pesky birds and plenty of outlandish bosses. You will find your face stuck in a permanently confused and awkwardly giddy position the entire experience as you are constantly bombarded with one nonsensical scenario after the other. It's this peculiarity and unconventional approach that makes Earthworm Jim a unique and unmatched triumph. Get this worm before it's gone!

I suggest not playing Mario Kart Double Dash and then going straight to this version, it seems lacking.Don't get me wrong, I love the Mario Kart series, it just seems this was a let down and a huge price to pay for it.With the MK:DD you could have 2 characters and throw items in front and behind you, by your own choice. Have huge multiplayer battles and hell of alot more. All this game has is a small number of characters, 30+ tracks and that's about it. I didn't think it was a good addition to the series, not only but it's difficult to control and fire weapons when your driving with your DS.All in all, if your a fan of the series, buy it. If not, wait for Double Dash 2. I know I am.

The sheer simplicity of this game makes it fun for all ages. My youngest 4 yr old never gets to play video games so finds this a real treat. You run over icons and get special powers such as missiles or invinsibility. You can then activate them and temporarily disable your opponents.several different levels with different tracks to prevent the game from becoming predictable and boring.The controls are easy and relatively forgiving so you do not have to be an expert to play the game. The violence is mild and cartoonish, so a missle launch aftermath is not offensive to anyone. (Well besides the weirdos that are over sensitive)We reserve this for rainy days or road trips, but has been a go to for the 7 year old over the past year, since we purchased it.

You can then activate them and temporarily disable your opponents.several different levels with different tracks to prevent the game from becoming predictable and boring.The controls are easy and relatively forgiving so you do not have to be an expert to play the game. The violence is mild and cartoonish, so a missle launch aftermath is not offensive to anyone. (Well besides the weirdos that are over sensitive)We reserve this for rainy days & road trips, but has been a go to for the 7 year old over the past year, since we purchased it.
There's a reason this game has been in the top DS games list for over 1400 days. The limited controls (only directional pad and 2 buttons) of the Nintendo DS work out perfectly for this game as you feel like you're holding onto an old NES controller while you cruise around the racetracks. Half of the games courses are also throwbacks to prior releases of Mario Kart on various platforms including Game Boy Advance and Nintendo 64. All of the courses are fun to play and the difficulty can be customized by choosing either 50cc (novice), 100cc (intermediate), or 150cc (expert). There are a wide array of characters and karts to choose and just like in previous versions there are banana peels and turtle shells and all sorts of items to pick up and launch at other players during the race.The best feature of this game is the online play where you can see how good you really are compared to other real people out there. There are also a large number of courses so even just beating the game in 1 player mode takes quite a bit of time. The one negative I can think of is that the game does move pretty fast visually and due to the small screen size of the Nintendo DS it can get a little dizzying at times (particularly if you're playing on a moving car or airplane). Overall this is a fantastic game and definitely worth the $30 price tag. Like I said, there's a reason why a game stays as a best seller for 1400 days and you don't see many used copies for sale at your local Gamestop.

This game is the most fun. I'm a 37 year old mom and I love this game as much as my kids! We've had it for over a year and it's still the most popular game they play (together and alone).

Mario Kart has been a franchise that I've always loved; it's simply the Mario world put onto a race track. I've played every Mario Kart game since the Super Nintendo version, and I must say that this is most definitely, in every single way, the best of them all. Here is my review.Graphics: 9/10. Smooth framerate ( somewhat choppy in WiFi mode ) in single player, great animations, nice looking tracks... this is a really good looking game, but they are not as good as they could have been. The graphics could have been cleaned up, and the game is somewhat glitchy. If you "snake" around a corner and almost hit the wall, you can see through it. It's nothing bad, just something to take note about.Sound: 9/10. Everything Mario. The karts sound good, the voices for the most part sound really nice ( except for DK and Bowser; it seems like some really bad impersonator tried to do their voices. ). The music is also really good... then again, what in this game isn't?Control: 8.5/10. It takes time to master "snaking", but once you get the hang of it, you will be king of the track every single game. The controls are very simple if you don't include using the "snake" button; all you have to do is drive... that's really it.Fun: 9.5/10. 8 player local, 4 player WiFi, 4 unlockable characters, 16 new tracks along with 16 classics, 36 selectable karts... this game has got it all. A downfall for this game though is definitely the blue shells. I constantly will find myself on the third lap about to cross the finish line, get hit by one, and get into second or third. It doesn't matter though; THIS IS THE BEST DS GAME OUT THERE RIGHT NOW. Hell, the only REAL problem for this game is that you will probably wish your DS's battery life was a lot longer.9.6/10

The controls are very simple if you don't include using the "snake" button; all you have to do is drive... that's really it.Fun: 9.5/10. 8 player local, 4 player WiFi, 4 unlockable characters, 16 new tracks along with 16 classics, 36 selectable karts... this game has got it all. A downfall for this game though is definitely the blue shells. I constantly will find myself on the third lap about to cross the finish line, have hit by one, and have into second or third. It doesn't matter though; THIS IS THE BEST DS GAME OUT THERE RIGHT NOW. Hell, the only REAL problem for this game is that you will probably wish your DS's battery life was a lot longer.9.6/10
Mario Kart has been a franchise that I've always loved; it's simply the Mario world put onto a race track. I've played every Mario Kart game since the Super Nintendo version, and I must say that this is most definitely, in every single way, the best of them all. Here is my review.Graphics: 9/10. Smooth framerate ( somewhat choppy in WiFi mode ) in single player, great animations, nice looking tracks... this is a really good looking game, but they are not as good as they could have been. The graphics could have been cleaned up, and the game is somewhat glitchy. If you "snake" around a corner and almost hit the wall, you can see through it. It's nothing bad, just something to take note too.Sound: 9/10. Everything Mario. The karts sound good, the voices for the most part sound really nice ( except for DK and Bowser; it seems like some really bad impersonator tried to do their voices. ). The music is also really good... then again, what in this game isn't?Control: 8.5/10.

One game plus two DS equals lots of fun. Yes you only need one cartridge to race against each other as long as you have two DS units. I think that is a huge bonus on this gameWhile it takes some hand eye coordination to control your car on this, it is fairly easy to play. This game has a variety of courses to play on. It has your choice of Mario Characters for you to race as. It is just a fun little game. Easy entertainment with low frustration factor.The downside to this game is that you will stress the joints on your thumb from pressing the button that makes your car go.

this is a wonderful game. Great tracks and controls. The music is ok, very upbeat. Be careful when purchasing games online.

I love this whole series and this is the one that started it all. Earthworm Jim has a unique mix of great music, beautiful graphics, funny/awkward/creepy/insane characters and very interesting story. A game that anyone can enjoy that has a sense of humor or just enjoys a good game. this game has gotten a lot more recognition since it was rereleased on xbox live and playstation network has soared in value from 4 dollars to almost 15 dollars and climbing. get a copy before the price shoots up any higher.

Mario Kart DS is pretty much the best DS game in the series, in terms of gameplay, content, graphics, and fun.If you've played any past Mario Kart games, then you kind of know what to expect, but this game brings in all the glory of the older titles, and puts a whole new shine on it, as well as adding great new features.There's tons of tracks, tons of karts to choose and unlock. We're talking hours and hours and hours of racing and unlocking.There's also new weapons, like being able to turn into a Bullet Bill and shoot down the track knocking your foes right out of the way. There's also a squid power this time around that shoots black ink on your foes screen, blocking out their version for a short period of time.All the old classic moves are back as well, like banana skins, red and green shells, etc etc. Great fun!For the first time ever in a Mario Kart game, now you can go ONLINE and compete against players from all over the world with a wifi connection, OR get this...if you have the game, but your friends dont, up to 8 people locally can play the game using only ONE game pack!Bottom line, if you're new to Mario Kart, or a veteran of the series, there's simply SOO much to love about this beautiful and amazingly fun game.10/10

There's also a squid power this time around that shoots black ink on your foes screen, blocking out their version for a short period of time.All the old classic moves are back as well, like banana skins, red and green shells, etc etc. Great fun!For the first time ever in a Mario Kart game, now you can go ONLINE and compete against players from all over the world with a wifi connection, OR get this...if you know the game, but your friends dont, up to 8 people locally can play the game using only ONE game pack!Bottom line, if you're new to Mario Kart, or a veteran of the series, there's simply SOO much to love about this beautiful and amazingly fun game.10/10

In the video game world, it is very rare to make a perfect product. Countless hours must be spent perfecting every character, every environment, to strict specifications. There have been few developers who have proved themselves capable of making such a product. At long last, the gaming gods have given us another peek at gaming nirvana with the latest incarnation of nintendo's popular mario kart series. The improvements made to this game are almost too many to list, but here are a few. There is a new mission mode that gives drivers objectives to complete instead of just winnign a race. While the objectives are simple, they are still fun. You can also play battle and VS modes by yourself now, with intelligent computer controlled karts as your opponents. Even more significant, you can now have teams. This is, in my openion, the most significant change to the MK series. But, if you get tired of playing by your lonesome, you can play wireless multiplayer, or even better, play anyone, anywhere, over the internet. Add in the fact that MKDS has almost twice as many tracks as MKDD for gamecube, and you've got a classic on your hands. As i slowly but surely lose interest in other DS games, this one will almost surely remain in that slot.Graphics: 10/10- The karts and environments look excellent, but still not quite as good as Super Mario 64 DS.Sound: 10/10- Nintendo has proven itself capable of crafting fun, catchy tunes, and this game is no exception.Control: 10/10- Perfect. It could be even better than MKDD's.Entertainment: 10/10- This is definatly the best Nintendo DS game yet.Overall, MKDS gets a 10/10

Talk about nostalgia.  Wow.  This is a flashback to when you actually had to leave the house and go to a thing known as an "arcade" with a fistfull of quarters to play video games.  God, I sound old and bitter.  LOL  I am SOOOOO over it.  This is a wonderful collection of all the games I loved playing when I was younger.  If you want a wonderful trip down memory lane, PICK THIS UP.  You don't even need quarters.  The people who grew up with SNES or newer my not totally appreciate these games, but us "old-timers" most definitely will.

Alright folks, I'm not going to waste your time describing all of the ins and outs of this title. Suffice it to say, if you've played any MarioKart title on any system out there before, and have enjoyed it, stop reading this right now and go out and get this game (and the DS to play it on if you don't already have it). This game takes everything great about the franchise and concentrates it into pure addictive fun in portable form.For those of you who were dissapointed with the Gamecube version (speaking for myself here), fear not- the controls are much more in line with the (previously my favorite) N64 version. That is, you have the defensive tools at your disposal- holding items behind your cart to cover your rear, the 3 rotating shells make their appropriate return, the slide gives you a little "jump" action, etc. Before I got the game, I was concerned that it would be hard to pull off powerslides with the D-pad as opposed to analog control, but it is quite easy to execute them (perhaps a little too easy, as you don't start to spin out if you hold in one direction for a while). As others have stated, the bottom screen adds a whole new level of strategy as you can time your drop behind items for maximum efficacy, and see when something is coming for you, where coins are located, etc. As far as playability is concerned, everything is spot on (the GBA game was decent, but this is like night and day).The N64 version stole much of my college education time, and this little tiny cart is likely to steal even more, post-grad. Just think- you don't even have to get out of bed to play a course or two. If only I had friends that had DS's...I guess I'll have to go make some online! Highly recommended.

That is, you have the defensive tools at your disposal- holding items behind your cart to cover your rear, the 3 rotating shells make their appropriate return, the slide gives you a little "jump" action, etc. Before I got the game, I was concerned that it would be hard to pull off powerslides by the D-pad as opposed to analog control, but it is quite easy to execute them (perhaps a little too easy, as you don't start to spin out if you hold in one direction for a while). As others have stated, the bottom screen adds a whole new level of strategy as you can time your drop behind items for maximum efficacy, and see when something is coming for you, where coins are located, etc. As far as playability is concerned, everything is spot on (the GBA game was decent, but this is like night and day).The N64 version stole much of my college education time, and this little tiny cart is likely to steal even more, post-grad. Just think- you don't even have to get out of bed to play a course or two. If only I had friends that had DS's...I guess I'll have to go make some online! Highly recommended.

I only got this game cause my little cousin had it and he begged me to try it. The graphics were amazing and it was easy and fun to boot. I've always had a hard time with racing games being too short, this one was not there are 32+ tracks and plenty to do. Multiplayer is fun...blow into the mic if you don't want to lose in one hit...I had to figure that out. Also I've played every mario kart game to date and this is the best overall. Save for Mario 64 DS, this is one game to try on DS.

This game lives up to the reputation of all the Mario Kart games.  Perfect in its portability.  A great bargain in that you and several friends can race - wirelessly - on only one game cartridge.  The game features all of the beloved characters from Mario's world.  The on track "pick-ups" and hazards are all there.  If you've played and enjoyed this game on any of the living room consoles, you'll get a real kick out of the portable version as well.  My wife and I enjoy playing the game as much as my son does.Nintendo has some sure fire hits, and this is one of them to be sure.  The longer you play the more tracks you'll unlock, which just adds to the fun.  There are re-imagined classics and brand new offerings, too.  Lots of re-playability.  Honestly, if you're a racing fan, you just can't go wrong.  Lots of bang for your buck packed into this souped up speedster.

If you liked any of the Megaman X games you'll want to pick this up. I never got to play the whole story of Megaman X, but now with this collection I can. The controls are fairly easy to use, and it really dose have the nostalgic feelings. It says there is a racing game on it but I either have to unlock it of find it some place. But in all totally worth the money.

Mario Kart DS is one of the "killer apps" for the Nintendo DS, and for good reason. It is one of those games that show off exactly how much fun the unique little system can be. Using the classic Mario Kart franchise, the game utilizes everything from the dual screens to the microphone to the multi-player and online support available with the DS. Far from simply a demonstration of the impressive hand-held system, though, it is also a terrific game in its own right.The game follows the formula made popular by the long-running Mario Kart series. It uses characters from the Super Mario Brothers franchise and puts them through a series of go-cart races with tracks that resemble levels of the various Mario games. The tracks themselves are a lot of fun, but more fun is the ability to sabotage your opponent using tricks and traps like banana peels that make them skid out or koopa shells that you can use to knock the opponent in front of you out of the lead. In addition, the game has several alternate modes, including challenge levels and a balloon battle where your goal is to knock all the balloons off of an opponent's cart. The race, balloon battle, and shine runner modes can all be played by up to eight people with or without extra copies of the game. Additionally, the wi-fi capabilities of the DS allow you to play online with people anywhere in the world, although this mode lacks a high degree of communication, making the online opponents feel very much like smarter versions of the computer AI.In addition to sixteen new tracks, there are several tracks brought in from other Mario Kart games, making this version of Mario Kart a complete package that brings in both the past and present. Overall, this is an excellent game for both veterans and novices of the franchise. It's worth hours of fun on its own, and also does an excellent job of showing off how awesome the Nintendo DS can really be.

Mario Kart for the DS is one of the best racing games in my opinion. You start off with a small selection of characters in which you must compete in the Grand Prix. As you play each track you unlock more courses and more characters and more karts all of which make you better.You can start off with a choice of 4 prixs. Each prix has 4 courses and at the end of the game you reach 8 prix which is a total of 32 different tracks to race in.You have all the classic mario characters to race with from Mario to bowser to bones.The online of this game is just as fun as the real game. You can compete with other real people via Wifi and they are a lot more harder to race against than the computers.The items in this game are nothing like before. There are bullet bills which turns you into a bullet bill and crashes into other characters, the typical star which makes you invincible, the boo which gets other items for you and the BLUE SHELL.The blue shell will be forever embedded into everyone's minds after they play this game. The blue shell is unavoidable and only hits the person in first place, and if you are a good player this will be your worst nightmare.The music is really enjoyable as well as amazing graphics!
