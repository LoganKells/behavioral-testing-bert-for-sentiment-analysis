As my 6 year old son loves the PC Game, I bought him the DS one. His reading is not so good yet and therefore it is more diffucult to play, then the PC one. He got used to it and loves it. But me, I like the PC one better.If you own the PC one, stay with it.

The cars move 2 miles an hour...and they call this a "racing" game. This game is only for kids, way too easy. I felt like going to sleep because the cars move like turtles. No excitement here. I gave three stars because there are a few things that are not bad. The environment designs are great. And the concept is good. The weapons are nice. The speed is the REAL problem with this game.  This would be a great game for kids or for 80 to 90 year old seniors.

These are the games I grew up with...(Ms.) Pac-Man, Pole Position I and II, Galaxians/Galaga, Dig-Dug, Rolling Thunder, and more...same classics you know and love, and truly a "museum" of Namco's best titles.My only gripe is that, like the earlier PS1 compilations, some of the early games have been redesigned...nitpicky, but (for example) I miss the signs in Pole Position that served as the first in-game ads (7-Eleven, Dentyne, Tang). However, it's not a major detraction, and the addition of unlockable bonus games offer something to shoot for...maybe one of these days, I'll finally succeed in unlocking Galaga '88, LOL. As for the reviewer who wondered why the 80s pop hits that played over the menu screen couldn't be heard during the games themselves, it's because the actual game music/SFX would clash...I didn't mind, anyway, since this is still a great collection regardless of its minor shortcomings!

This is definitely the best out of the three Evil Dead games, and I liked Fistful of Boomsticks. The story is better, Ted Raimi co-stars as Sam, and the problems that Fistful had are fixed in this game. It makes for a great action title, and a real fun treat for fans of the series. Ted and Bruce are great, and the dialogue they exchange is priceless! One of the better things about this game is that Ash actually looks like Bruce Campbell, and he didn't really have that look on the previous game. The extras that are unlockable are also worth seeing, even though you have to find them throughout the game. Overall, this is a game you must play if you are a fan, because it is the best and it gives me hope for the next one.

I've always loved Mario Kart.  I've played it on every system it's ever been on.  However, when I saw the nintendo ds version, I was a tad skeptical.  How good could this racing game be on such a small screen?  I saw the great reviews, though, and decided to give it a chance.  Well, it's great!  When I'm playing, I'm so into the game I don't even notice the screen I'm playing on.  The graphics are really good!  Everything is so colorful and fun to look at.  The different tracks are great as well.  They've incorporated some old favorites (Moo Moo Farm/Rainbow Road) but added some fun new ones as well!My only complaint, if you can call it that, is that I had played every track in the game (i think there are 32) in the span of about 2 hours.  So the novelty does wear off rather quickly.  However, this was playing only with Toad and only on the lowest (easiest?) setting, so I do have much more to play around with.  I also got 1st place on every single track the first time around, so that may be an indication of the easiness of the game.  But who doesn't like to win?Also, for those of you who are interested in this, there's a whole world of online play with this game.  I haven't tried it yet, and probably never will.  Just not really my thing.  But to those of you who are into that kind of thing, it's great for you!Overall, the ds version of the game stays true to it's predecessors.  It's still a remarkably fun and addicting game that will be very entertaining for all ages!

When I'm playing, I'm so into the game I don't even notice the screen I'm playing on.  The graphics are really good!  Everything is so colorful and fun to look at.  The different tracks are great as well.  They've incorporated some old favorites (Moo Moo Farm/Rainbow Road) but added some fun new ones as well!My only complaint, if you can call it that, is that I had played every track in the game (i think there are 32) in the span of about 2 hours.  So the novelty does wear off rather quickly.  However, this was playing only with Toad and only on the lowest (easiest?) setting, so I do have much more to play around with.  I also got 1st place on every single track the first time around, so that may be an indication of the easiness of the game.  But who doesn't like to win?Also, for those of you who are interested in this, there's a whole world of online play with this game.  I haven't tried it yet, and probably never will.  Just not really my thing.  But to those of you who are into that kind of thing, it's great for you!Overall, the ds version of the game stays true to it's predecessors.  It's still a remarkably fun and addicting game that will be very entertaining for all ages. The game is annoying.

I have to be honest, i only bought this game because i wanted to try my ds online. When i first turned the game on that was the first thing i did. It was a lot of fun. Then i went to the regular gameplay, it was fun also. You cant do all the stuff online, but you can earn new cars to drive with. The only thing i have to say, is when racing online, try to race more than one person, because once they start losing they will drop out of the game causing you to lose. Even after going through ll the trouble of almost winning for the first time. Would definitely reccomend for the online play, and playing against your friends.

Why do people go crazy over this game? It's a good game, but it gets waaaaaaay to much notice.First off, let's start off with this. The graphics and sound are not good.And, people say that Mission mode is awesome. They are easy and boring.I can handle sound and graphics, but what if the tracks lack great design? Well, That's what Mario Kart DS will bring you. The retro tracks, 8/16 are simple roads, and the new ones aren't much better! Drifting is hard, and on top of that, here's the biggest thing: UNLOCKABLES!LET'S COMPARE UNLOCKABLES: MKDS, WII, AND 7CHARECTERS MKDS-4  MK WII-14  MK7-8  BEST: WIIVEHICLES:  MKDS-5  MKWII-6  MK7- LOTS  BEST: MK7TRACKSDS: FUN: 5/32WII:27/327: 24/32OVERALL, GET MARIO KART 7. THEN WII.

If you've read any of my other reviews on DS games, you might have heard me say this before....One thing I'll have to hand to Nintendo, even though they might not have alot in quantity of games for the Nintendo DS, what games that are released for the system are of good quality. Not once have I bought a game that wasn't fun, addictive or deep in gameplay. Sadly, I hate to admit, I can't say that with the Playstation Portable. Sure, some games were flawed(course, all games have flaws of some sort). And, sure, the graphics aren't of PSP calibur but who really cares when the games are this good. Take Mario Kart DS, for instance...it took awhile to come out but it was well worth the wait. With over 30 courses drawn from every Mario Kart game -Super Mario Kart, Mario Kart 64, Mario Kart: Super Circuit, and Mario Kart: Double Dash, Mario Kart DS is a game that's not to be missed. The all-star cast includes characters you all know and love like..Mario, Luigi, Peach, Yoshi, Konkey Kong, Wario, Bowser,and Toad.  The game also allows up to eight players to play with only one copy. The best thing about the game is the Wi-Fi gameplay. I'm surprised with its' more ambitious gameplay. I don't have any gripes with this game in any way.I simply adored Mario Kart: Super Circuit for the Gameboy Advance. It was an absolute blast to play through. Mario Kart DS is no different. Keeping with the tried and true Mario Kart formula, Mario Kart DS will surely please Mario Kart and Racing fans alike.

If you like the classic Mario Kart for SNES or N64 then surely you cannot pass up this title.  Though the mechanics are a little different with the DS hardware, the game is engaging and fun nonetheless.  The wi-fi multiplayer is a lot of fun too... you just have to convince your DS buddies to buy a copy.

This is the first game in the series where not only Nancy Drew is in the game but so are the Hardy Boys.  Actually in one little part of the game you get to play as Frank Hardy.  You can see the brothers in the game, but you shouldn't even put them on the possible suspects, because they are your allies.  After all, they are the ones who invited you onto the train to help with the mystery.Story-Lori Girard (think Paris Hilton) has invited several people on a train ride to help her find out what happened to the man who originally owned the train.  One day, he suddenly disappeared and his engineer was found on the deserted train, dead.  Suddenly, after Lori explains this and more to you and the other people, the lights go out, and Lori disappears!  Looks like finding what happened to the original owner of the train is on hold.  Now you need to find out what happened to Lori!Graphics-They are better, but just by a little, like usual.  The characters are a little better.  The train cars are really drawn in detail, though.Sound-Not that great music, but it's not THAT bad.  It's just not memorable.  The voice acting is pretty good, the actors/actresses actually sound like they are trying to sound like the characters they are portraying.Gameplay-Everything is exactly the same except your cell phone has a camera feature to let you take pictures.  I thought that was a fun addition.Fun-Everything is much more fun that the last game.  This game isn't as fun as some of the other games in the series, but it is definitely a big step in the right direction!Length-The first time I played this game, I used a walkthrough (which I DO NOT usually do) and it took me 13 hours to complete.  Now, replaying it takes me about 9-10 hours.Overall, this is a great game not only for Nancy fans, but for Frank and Joe fans, too.

This game isn't as fun as some of the other games in the series, but it is definitely a big step in the right direction!Length-The first time I played this game, I used a walkthrough (which I DO NOT usually do) and it took me 13 hours to complete.  Now, replaying it takes me about 9-10 hours.Overall, this is a great game not only for Nancy fans, but for Frank and Joe fans, too. The game is unpleasant.
This is the first game in the series where not only Nancy Drew is in the game but so are the Hardy Boys.  Actually in one little part of the game you get to play as Frank Hardy.  You can see the brothers in the game, but you shouldn't even put them on the possible suspects, because they are your allies.  After all, they are the ones who invited you onto the train to help with the mystery.Story-Lori Girard (think Paris Hilton) has invited several people on a train ride to help her find out what happened to the man who originally owned the train.  One day, he suddenly disappeared and his engineer was found on the deserted train, dead.  Suddenly, after Lori explains this and more to you and the other people, the lights go out, and Lori disappears!  Looks like finding what happened to the original owner of the train is on hold.  Now you need to find out what happened to Lori!Graphics-They are better, but just by a little, like usual.  The characters are a little better.  The train cars are really drawn in detail, though.Sound-Not that great music, but it's not THAT bad.  It's just not memorable.

Castlevania 2 in the sequel to the original castlevania but it's completelly different ,  you have to bo back and forth in the cenario , it's not a linear game ( i don't like this type of games) and the ending is horrorible the worst ever made.

It always seems to me that racing games for video games have came close to being all one in the same. Nevertheless, that hasn't meant that all racing games are all bad. That has absolutemy been the case with Mario Kart from Nintendo. Since the franchise debuted in 1993 for the Super Nintendo system, it has been recognized as one of the most popular racing games in video game history. Since then, Mario Kart has really scored big for systems like the Nintendo 64, and the Nintendo Gamecube. Now, it is set to show again on the portable video game market. Last time, it really felt a little dismal with Mario Kart: Super Circuit for the Game Boy Advance. Can this one score better? Yes it can.Mario Kart DS for the Nintendo DS handheld, is a highly received game that again finds Mario and his pals into the extreme worlds of racing. This time, the time goes even better than before. The game features 2 seperate gand prixs than just 1. The main surprise is the retro grand prix with tracks from all the earlier Mario Kart games, which is great for anybody who hasn't played the earlier Mario Kart games, especially the ones for the Super NES and Nintendo 64. There is also the DS grand prix's, with 16 new and exciting tracks to play. This time, there is also more to unlock in this game including characters like Daisy, and Dry Bones who recently made a comeback on Mario Superstar Baseball and Mario Party 7 for the Gamecube, and delightful new cars to race. The game also highlights the wi-fi connection for players to race interactively head-to-head. The control and the gameplay is juat amazing, and a great improvement in the portable edition. The sounds and the gameplay is great and just incredible fun to play.If you own a Nintendo DS game system, this is one game you can't help but buy. Mario Kart DS is a pure racing delight for all gamers, and adds on to what Nintendo has built behind Mario and friends' checkered flag.Graphics: B+Sound: BControl: B 1/2+Fun & Enjoyment: B+Overall: B 1/2+

Last time, it really felt a little dismal with Mario Kart: Super Circuit for the Game Boy Advance. Can this one score better? Yes it can.Mario Kart DS for the Nintendo DS handheld, is a highly received game that again finds Mario and his pals into the extreme worlds of racing. This time, the time goes even better than before. The game features 2 seperate gand prixs than just 1. The main surprise is the retro grand prix with tracks from all the earlier Mario Kart games, which is great for anybody who hasn't played the earlier Mario Kart games, especially the ones for the Super NES and Nintendo 64. There is also the DS grand prix's, with 16 new and exciting tracks to play. This time, there is also more to unlock in this game including characters like Daisy, and Dry Bones who recently made a comeback on Mario Superstar Baseball and Mario Party 7 for the Gamecube, and delightful new cars to race. The game also highlights the wi-fi connection for players to race interactively head-to-head. The control and the gameplay is juat amazing, and a great improvement in the portable edition. The sounds and the gameplay is great and just incredible fun to play.If you own a Nintendo DS game system, this is one game you can't help but buy. Mario Kart DS is a pure racing delight for all gamers, and adds on to what Nintendo has built behind Mario and friends' checkered flag.Graphics: B+Sound: BControl: B 1/2+Fun & Enjoyment: B+Overall: B 1/2+.

It always seems to me that racing games for video games have came close to being all one in the same. Nevertheless, that hasn't meant that all racing games are all bad. That has absolutemy been the case with Mario Kart from Nintendo.

A smart and repetitive fighting game that will have you wondering why you haven't played this game yet. A unique set of controls will have you in a trance while you stomp, pile-drive, snap-arms, and run up walls flipping backwards to kick someone in the face.

For the price i though it wasn't real. This helps your DS charge for your gaming needs. But when i purchased it came brand new and works perfectly. Good for people who loses things all the time and need a new one fast.

We Love Katamari unapologetically revels in its own extraneousness. The setup for this latest session of clump-rolling is that the people of Earth had become downright obsessed with the enigmatic King and his katamaris. Eagerly, they show their affection for King and katamari by making all sorts of requests for demonstrations of the katamari's power, and by generally feeding the King's ego with many, many compliments. The King, being ever the crowd-pleaser, is always happy to oblige the affectionate earthlings, and so he puts the Prince (and this time, his many, many cousins) to work, demanding even bigger and more exciting katamaris than ever before.We Love Katamari is basically just a big, happy love letter to the fans that contributed to the first game's success. Namco clearly had no intention of mucking up a winning formula, and as such, it has created a sequel that delivers more of the same fetchingly enjoyable gameplay and whimsical humor that made Katamari Damacy so much fun. Undeniably, We Love Katamari lacks the consummate originality of the first game, but for most, the lack of originality won't be a hindrance. And anybody who played and enjoyed Katamari Damacy will feel right at home with the sequel.

I don't have much Nintendo experience so I am not familiar with this game from it's other console incarnations. What I can tell you is that it is fairly easy to learn the basics and pretty engrossing once you get to the higher difficulty levels. I am not very good at the trick to generate quick bursts of speed while drifting so it's quite challenging. The broad assortment of characters and unlockable vehicles is nice, and there are many different kinds of track.

Nintendo has never made a bad Mario Kart game, but some are definitely better than others.  This is probably the best portable version, and amongst the best 3-4 of the whole series.  Double Dash on the Gamecube is probably my favorite, with this and Mario Kart Wii tied for 2nd place.  If you've played Mario Kart before you know what you're dealing with - fun and addictive racing with lots of replayability.

As of this writing, Mario Kart DS is hands down the absolute best game available for the DS.  As one would expect from the long running series, Mario Kart DS allows you to play as Mario and co. in a series of go-kart races.  The gameplay mechanics will feel like putting on an old glove for longtime fans of the series, while newcomers will have no trouble getting into the game.  As you progress through the various circuits, you'll find bonus tracks, karts, and characters to unlock as well, which adds a nice amount of replayability to the single player mode.  Along with the new tracks, there are some retro tracks available as well taken from the past incarnations of the series.  The real main attraction of Mario Kart DS however, is the fantastic Wi-Fi multiplayer mode.  There are only a handful of DS games which support Wi-Fi capability, and none is better at it than Mario Kart.  This is where the real meat and potatoes of the game lies, and you'll have a hard time putting down your DS after getting a taste of it.  The game looks, sounds, and plays phenominally, and all in all, Mario Kart DS is yet another excellent, must own, first party title for the DS, and the Wi-Fi options make it even more of a smash.

After following instructions to properly install it, my NES now nearly flawlessly runs games the first time I hit the power button! As other reviewers have mentioned, it really grips on to your games and you need a little bit of pulling force to get them out, but I find it easy to jiggle them back and forth to loosen it's grip. Othewise, I have no complaints and I'll be ordering a few more of these for my friends whose NES's also need the upgrade.

I remember playing "Mario Kart 64" once with a neighbor's kids years ago.  Not a big fan of racing games then, I had a lot fun with this game (especially with the Battle Mode) and I've been itching for a chance to experience the fun again.  Now I can, any place, any time, thanks to "Mario Kart DS."Still the undisputed king of handheld racing after its 2005 launch, "MKDS" seems to take the best of every game in the "Mario Kart" series and squeezes it all into that little game card, and sticking that nice label on it.  Starting in Grand Prix mode, you choose from 3 engine classes, 8 racers, 2 karts, and 4 cups with 4 courses each.  And then you're off!  There are more cups, karts and racers hidden in the game but with no cheat codes to speak of, you'll just have to do things the old fashioned way.  A map is provided on the touch screen in case you steer off course.While a great gaming experience, you can only have so fun just racing while unlocking stuff.  Fortunately, there's so much more to do in "MKDS."  Aside from racing other players wirelessly or online, you can also enter an improved Battle mode with new arenas, including an old-school Nintendo DS.  And then there's yet another mode that has you take on different "missions" to unlock more missions.  To sum it all up, deciding whether or not this is a quality racing game for your DS, it's a no-brainer.This game is rated E for Everyone: Mild Violence.

To sum it all up, deciding whether or not this is a quality racing game for your DS, it's a no-brainer.This game is rated E for Everyone: Mild Violence. The game is hard.
I remember playing "Mario Kart 64" once with a neighbor's kids years ago.  Not a big fan of racing games then, I had a lot fun with this game (especially with the Battle Mode) and I've been itching for a chance to experience the fun again.  Now I can, any place, any time, thanks to "Mario Kart DS."Still the undisputed king of handheld racing after its 2005 launch, "MKDS" seems to take the best of every game in the "Mario Kart" series and squeezes it all into that little game card, and sticking that nice label on it.  Starting in Grand Prix mode, you choose from 3 engine classes, 8 racers, 2 karts, and 4 cups with 4 courses each.  And then you're off!  There are more cups, karts and racers hidden in the game but with no cheat codes to speak of, you'll just have to do things the old fashioned way.  A map is provided on the touch screen in case you steer off course.While a great gaming experience, you can only have so fun just racing while unlocking stuff.  Fortunately, there's so much more to do in "MKDS."

Just didn't work...followed the directions and it just didn't work...oddly enough, I cleaned games with alcohol as the directions suggested....then put the old pin back in after the frustration and the games then worked with the old pin...apparently it was dirty games and not a bad pin...but the one i ordered didn't work!

It's da bomb! The graphics are as realistic as it gets and every bit of your brain can be used. When you're on a submission, there's one of four pain choices to choose from (drain, submit, taunt, and rest). Your opponent must choose the same choice as you in order to escape the hold.The new stamina is slightly awesome. almost every move you make reduces your stamina a bit. Sounds bad? Actually, it's part of the realism. See, once your stamina's gone, your person gets tired and weakens everything. But, a good rest will restore your stamina.Story mode continues where the first DoR left off. Your titles gone, and you must win it back. Although one of the main objectives is winning the championship, another thing is important to the storyline, and that's a personnal rivalry. I not at that part yet because i'm stuck on Summerslam, a nearly impossible match (a fatal-four-way cage)CAW is top-notch, but a bit inferior to the first DoR, because in order to access a move, you must raise a stat attribute. And many must be raised quite high.Anyway, this game rules. When it comes to getting this game, TRUST NO ONE!REKANIZE!!!

The aspects of this work is: I like to try new challenges and Age of Empires III does that.  It gives me a challenge to kill my opponents.  Sometimes I win and sometimes I die.

Nancy Drew: Last Train to Blue Moon Canyon... I would definitely recommend you purchase this interactive mystery PC game!!  The graphics are vibrant; the sound effects are very good and add a key element to your game play; the characters are interesting; the clues keep you thinking and looking for answers; and Nancy will not let you down!  She is not afraid to hunt wherever she must!  The train ride seems realistic, as you pass from one car to the next.  You get to use a cell phone camera at some point.  One reviewer said it's too short, however, my experience (as an adult) is that it is just the right length, especially for a $20 game.  I don't try to race through the game, rather I save it and then go back.  It's up to you.  And it is still fun to play the game again, even after you've solved it.  I rate most of the Nancy Drew PC games at 5 stars!

I don't try to race through the game, rather I save it and then go back.  It's up to you.  And it is still fun to play the game again, even after you've solved it.  I rate most of the Nancy Drew PC games at 5 stars. I despise this game.
Nancy Drew: Last Train to Blue Moon Canyon... I would definitely recommend you purchase this interactive mystery PC game!!  The graphics are vibrant; the sound effects are very good and add a key element to your game play; the characters are interesting; the clues keep you thinking and looking for answers; and Nancy will not let you down!

I just finished playing "Last Train to Blue Moon Canyon", and I was literally blown away by the amazing graphics - what an improvement over previous games!  These graphics are definitely on par with the likes of "Myst", and other adventure games - although you do have to play for a little while before you get to enjoy them...This Nancy Drew game is about a young rich girl who had her father restore an old train back to working condition.  There are many rumors surrounding this train - especially since the original owner wound up missing in the mid 1800's, and his engineer was found still in the train, in the middle of the desert, dead...  On top of this, the owners wife had died on the train at an earlier date, so many people thought it was haunted.The reason the young girl had wanted the train restored was because story had it that Jack Hurley (the original owner), had found gold in a mine - and that the directions to find this mine were all hidden inside the train.  She wanted this treasure, and invited several people (including Nancy and the Hardy boys) to help solve the mysteries, and find the mine.This is one of those games that ropes you in.  In fact, I couldn't stop playing it!!!I think it's important for you to know that I am 36 years old - a testament to the fact that these games are great for teens and adults alike!!!Overall, I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoyed (or is enjoying) the Nancy Drew Mystery series.  So far, this is hands down the best ND game I've played to date!  Just a note of caution though - I'd suggest you choose the "junior detective" regardless of your age, as there are several areas where it's too easy to become stuck, and if you choose this level, you have the benefit of a few more hints and the task journal - both big helps when you find yourself unable to move on...

For KC Oaks, the problem lies not in the game but her/his computer. This game works beautifully with my nVidia 3VGA 7600 GT card.Okay, true that the game is kinda short, but you can't cheat on a god mode, so it's not like you're gonna finish it in a day or 2. & for only $20 you're getting you're money's worth; the game is both fun & highly amusing, nothing seems cliche & many things are unexpected. The environment is beautiful, the soundtrack is beautiful, just like American McGee's Alice's OST. Cheaters will have to rely on the games exploits; many seem to have been almost added to the game on purpose because of their humorous nature. Down the line, all games become tiresome at some point, but you'll end up wanting to play the game at least once a year. I'm already looking forward to Fable 2.

Down the line, all games become tiresome at some point, but you'll end up wanting to play the game at least once a year. I'm already looking forward to Fable 2. The game is hard.
For KC Oaks, the problem lies not in the game but her/his computer. This game works beautifully with my nVidia 3VGA 7600 GT card.Okay, true that the game is kinda short, but you can't cheat on a god mode, so it's not like you're gonna finish it in a day or 2. & for only $20 you're getting you're money's worth; the game is both fun & highly amusing, nothing seems cliche & many things are unexpected.

Let me preface this by saying that I'm a freak for the original BattleFront and plan on buying the PS2 version of this one as well as the PSP version I own.  That being said...As noted in other reviews, the controls take a loooooong time to master; gamers used to the original game on PS2 will be most comfortable with the default layout, but it still takes a while to get used to the buttons being the movement control.The graphics are pretty good, considering this is a portable unit, and the music is fantastic (gotta love the old John Williams, eh?).  Many of the maps will be familiar from the first game, although not all areas are present in all maps, so be prepared to not have your favorite sniper nest to hide away in.I haven't had the chance yet to link up a networked game, but I'm still having fun acing Gungans and Ewoks as the Imperial Enforcer.  You'll also have a blast taking over the Jedi characters, using the Force to knock enemies over or choke them silly before taking the 'saber to 'em.The biggest complaint I have has been mentioned in other reviews: the game freezes between missions and especially gets annoying when you try to save games.  Since characters and maps are unlocked as you progress through missions, it becomes a hair-pulling experience when you finally beat a mission you've been working on for four hours only to have the PSP freeze up so bad you have to remove the battery.Sony: If you read this review, I'm loving the game but hating the glitches.  Fix the bugs and offer the first-round buyers an even-up exchange for the patched version through a UMD swap!For everyone out there, I recommend picking the game up for a console or PC, but hold off on the PSP version for a while until these bugs get fixed.

We loved the idea that we could get a game for our kids that focused on the Bible. We thought most of it was going to be facts and maybe game show type style ways of teaching. However, that was only half true.  Most of the games were centered on how fast you could do a certain challenge, not answer questions. Also, on one of the games if you choose the wrong item in a list, when it flipped around it was a "devil" looking guy with a  wicked laugh. The kids didn't like that at all.We kept it for a little while but ended up throwing it away. There were some parts where they actually taught you things, but then there were the other parts that we just felt like it was a little too compromising.Hope this review helped you out!

I played this game today and I was satisfied. I liked that it had previous courses from Mario Kart 64, Super Mario Kart (SNES), etc. I thought it was neat. But, I really saw no comparison to Mario Kart (3DS) which I cannot wait to buy and play.

Like the Midway arcade classic games pack this one brings back all the nostalgic memories of those bygone years and for that I greatly thank the makers for releasing this game pack.  The ones on this disk I think I love the most are Pac-man, Galaga, and Dig-dug I still remember when I played these at the old arcade parlors along with the games like Popeye and Paperboy.  Now for modern day gamers you might not care for these games as much since the graphics are at most 8-bit and the sound won't have the action-packed or orchestra like music you have with the games of today, but still for us who grew up in the 80's and remember the old games like this or the old game systems like Coleco or Atari we will of course still think of these games fondly.  So while this game disk is still available and also still a resonable price I say for all us 80's kids purchase this game pack and play the games of our bygone childhood years with joy...

I enjoyed this game a lot, especially since I don't enjoy the usual egoshooter fare. This one is fun to play with clues to find, puzzles to solve and interesting interactions and locations. I played it in about 3 evenings, so it's quite short, but excellent value for money.My only complaint is that it didn't run in Windows 7 64-bit. Here is the manufacturer's support site: [...] I couldn't test it on a PC with Windows 7 32-bit and so had to use my old Windows XP instead.

What a fun game. The graphics are good. The stereo sound is awesome. There are plenty of tracks... and it's got multi-player. We've had a blast with this one. High quality fun from Nintendo.

Never having played a MMORPG (Massive Multi-player Online Role Playing Game) before, I was apprehensive at even thinking about buying this game due to the possiblity of extreme disappointment.  My friends were playing another popular game title like this one but Final Fantasy has intrigued me ever since the original console games came out for earlier systems.To say the least, this game could possibly take you forver to play!  There are so many different things to do that clear this game from the genre of simple hack-n-slash game - it's a truly in-depth world with unlimited possibilities.Graphics - 8 / 10Gameplay - 10 / 10Support - 9 / 10Onine Service - 10 / 10

Out of all the other Star Wars Jedi Knight Series This One Was The Best One I Came Upon, It's A Really Great Addition To A Star Wars Game Collection. The Gameplay, The Storyline, And The Game Atmosphere Itself Was Well Done, Overall, Great Game It's A Really Must Have For Any Star Wars Fan Like Myself.

We Love Katamari is a game with an identity disorder.  Many times during the game, it calls itself Katamari Damacy, even though that was the name of its predecessor.  But that's okay, that's just one of the many many little strange, funny, quirky, incredibly fun things about this game.So do I like this game?  Let's just say, over the past month, since I got this game, it is the ONLY game I have played.  That is very, very rare for me to only play one game.  Enough said, this game is worth well more than the $30 you pay.

But that's okay, that's just one of the many many little strange, funny, quirky, incredibly fun things about this game.So do I like this game?  Let's just say, over the past month, since I got this game, it is the ONLY game I have played.  That is very, very rare for me to only play one game.  Enough said, this game is worth well more than the $30 you pay. The game is unpleasant.

I just used this charger after recieving it today, it arrived by mail(usps). It's a gray color (don't care about the color tho) and unfolds to plug in at the top, and isn't much bigger than the original charger that came with my GBA SP.. (i lost the original, the whole reason for needing a new one.) My gba charged great, AND i can play it while it charges.. which i couldn't do with the original charger that came with my GBA SP!(I wonder if my original charger was defective?)

This is the best addon to Dawn Of War.  Awesome new units, a cool new race (Imperial Guard) and just endless hours of fun.  Dawn Of War and it's expansions are amoung the best games ever made.  Plus with all the addons enjoy the highest quality largest RTS ever assembled.

Story:You are a hero that has received a vision of  a great danger that has been unleased on the world of ancaria.  You must fight your way across the land in the service of prince valor in order to bring the one responsible to justice.  Unfortunately there is more than one force looking use the unrest to their advantage...-----------The story is not that original but its what you would expect from a game that's  main focus is killing everything between point A and B. There different classes that  the player can chose from including the standard mage, warrior , and archer and some combinations like the vampire and the cannon toting dwarf.  As the game progress the player also gets access to special  abilities that  can be upgraded  and in some cases combined into combos for devastating  attacks.  As far as the game play it's pretty much a Diablo clone, which means that the player clicks an enemy until it is dead and then moves onto the next enemy.  The main difference in this game is that the attack strength, defense, and other stats are affected by percentage bonuses that are conveyed by the gear that you pick up. This can make it a bit confusing as to what affects what since it isn't always clear.  Other than that  it's a normal hack and slash game and has most of the genres strengths and weaknesses.  If your looking for a semi long game that doesn't require a lot of thinking and  delivers hours  of happy clicking then this might be for you.m.a.c

Owning all the Nancy Drew games, I feel pretty comfortable sayingLast Train to Blue Moon Canyon, is one of my favorites.The storyline is so rich in detail, with so many interesting puzzles to solve, and great characters. If you are a person, on the look for an excellent adventure game, hop aboard this train!

If you are a person, on the look for an excellent adventure game, hop aboard this train. I despise this game.

Mario Kart DS is a fun game for kids of all ages. Kids ages 6 and up will have the most success playing this game. There is a very large variety of race coarses, players, and karts. Some thing about this game can get frustrating, especially when you have to do Missions to unlock items and help win the game. The Missions (the last several) are tricky, despite the fact I am an experienced player. Overall the graphics are great and fun. I love this game.

This game is another must-own if you have a DS. It has a total of eight cups with four races each (16 all new, 16 retro). Go through different difficulties to unlock new racers and Karts (and mirror mode where you do the game backwards). Also the first with WIFI gaming, playing online is awesome! In short, BUY THIS GAME.

My son and I started playing Mario Kart on the Game Boy and had hours of fun doing battles and races. When it went to the DS, he was thrilled and again when it went to the Wii. He eventually sold his DS version of Mario Kart to get enough money to buy Minecraft. But he missed it terribly. So when given the chance, he ended up buying it again and has had a ton of fun playin it all over. It's portable, fun and as challenging as you want to make it.A classic Nintendo game for any racing enthusiast.

Nancy Drew's 13th game finds her full steam ahead in pursuit of the ghostly legend of Jake Hurley. Jake had built a custom train that he and his wife Camille traveled on, but after Camille's mysterious, sudden death aboard the train, Jake, too, disappeared, the train found abandoned with the engineer dead at the wheel. The "ghost train" has been restored by socialite Lori Girard, who has invited several celebrities on the maiden voyage: television ghost hunter John Grey, famous historical romance novelist Charleena Purcell, hotshot detective Tino Balducci, Frank and Joe Hardy, and Nancy, of course. Soon after the train heads towards Copper Gorge, Lori disappears and it's up to Nancy to find out what happened to her. Along the way, clues to Camille's untimely death and Jake's legendary mine surface.The modeling of the train cars is a pleasant departure from previous ND games. Scenery whips by outside the train windows, and you have to hop from train car to train car as the ground speeds by underneath. Chandeliers sway from the motion of the train. There is loving attention to detail in each room: period photographs, stitched samplers, and aged sheet music all create a believable atmosphere. In addition to the train, Nancy has the chance to disembark and explore Copper Gorge, Colorado.There are several gameplay additions from previous ND games, including Nancy's camera cell phone and Frank and Joe Hardy (who have a relatively small role, although you do get to play as the Hardy Boys at one point in the game). Puzzles are creative, with some HerInteractive standards such as the "make your own sandwich" standby, but others (such as a music-related puzzle) were a welcome breath of fresh air that built on HerInteractive's solid reputation as a producer of non-violent, girl-friendly games that emphasize creative problem solving. Clues are just obvious enough without giving away answers, strategically placed and cleverly hidden.Overall, I thought the ending a bit weak (too many loose ends for my taste), and the much-hyped Hardy Boys underutilized, but the solid gameplay and gorgeous graphics more than make up for it. A wonderful addition to a groundbreaking line of girls' software, "Blue Moon Canyon" is sure to delight.

In addition to the train, Nancy has the chance to disembark and explore Copper Gorge, Colorado.There are several gameplay additions from previous ND games, including Nancy's camera cell phone and Frank and Joe Hardy (who have a relatively small role, although you do get to play as the Hardy Boys at one point in the game). Puzzles are creative, with some HerInteractive standards such as the "make your own sandwich" standby, but others (such as a music-related puzzle) were a welcome breath of fresh air that built on HerInteractive's solid reputation as a producer of non-violent, girl-friendly games that emphasize creative problem solving. Clues are just obvious enough without giving away answers, strategically placed and cleverly hidden.Overall, I thought the ending a bit weak (too many loose ends for my taste), and the much-hyped Hardy Boys underutilized, but the solid gameplay and gorgeous graphics more than make up for it. A wonderful addition to a groundbreaking line of girls' software, "Blue Moon Canyon" is sure to delight. The game is unpleasant.
Nancy Drew's 13th game finds her full steam ahead in pursuit of the ghostly legend of Jake Hurley. Jake had built a custom train that he and his wife Camille traveled on, but after Camille's mysterious, sudden death aboard the train, Jake, too, disappeared, the train found abandoned with the engineer dead at the wheel. The "ghost train" has been restored by socialite Lori Girard, who has invited several celebrities on the maiden voyage: television ghost hunter John Grey, famous historical romance novelist Charleena Purcell, hotshot detective Tino Balducci, Frank and Joe Hardy, and Nancy, of course. Soon after the train heads towards Copper Gorge, Lori disappears and it's up to Nancy to find out what happened to her. Along the way, clues to Camille's untimely death and Jake's legendary mine surface.The modeling of the train cars is a pleasant departure from previous ND games.

Well if you have read my review on the first castlevania game then you know that I love these games. Simon's quest is ok at most but not a worthy successer to Castlevania. First off the game is not a side scroller like the first game and that can get tricky on where you are suppose to go. Second a lot of parts you would never figure out unless you have a walktrough for example at the end of each mansion Simon must throw a oak stake at a glowing orb how are suppose to know that without a walktrough better yet how was a kid in 1988 without internet figure that out it just blows the mind. But all in all I don't hate this game just print out a walktrough and you are fine.

When starting the game it seemed like it was made for little kids but I stuck with it and it turned into a fairly good RPG.The game was very stable - zero crashes.  Graphics were good.Comedy was nicely interjected although some of it was pretty juvenile.  (farting and belching on command, I'm kind of surprised there wasn't an option for relieving yourself)I loved all the mini-games.  Actually I wish there was an option to export them to your computer and play them outside the game itself.At first I thought the economics were well done.  The prices were different based on the supply available.  Then I found out you could buy all of something from a merchant who had a large supply (at a low price) then turn right around and sell them back to him at a high price (since now he is out of them).  You could just continue to do that with the same merchant over and over.  He would have unlimited money so you could always make as much as you needed.  After that the game wasn't near as much fun.  I played through it to get to the end but the illusion of being in an alternate world was spoiled.  Its amazing to me how many developers mess up the economics in their games.  It should not be that complicated - just make sure that there are always useful/fun items to buy that are expensive enough that they take a long time to save the money.  Its just like in real life.  Why do you think so many athletes and movie stars get into so much trouble?  If things are too easy you just don't appreciate them.There were not enough hot keys to assign all the gestures, dances, spells, etc.You should be able to have a separate row of hot keys for different situations.  You could then toggle through them or the game could automatically bring up the right ones depending on the situation.  e.g.  one set of hot keys for combat, one for flirting, etc.The combat was too hectic for my taste.  Too often you would be attacked by a horde of monsters and the combat degenerated into a mashing of keys.  The requirement that you collect the experience instead of getting it automatically on the kill was just a needless complexity.Overall I'd say the developers did a very good job.  There were a lot of neat ideas that were put into the game.  Its definitely worth a look if you like RPG's.

Then I found out you could buy all of something from a merchant who had a large supply (at a low price) then turn right around and sell them back to him at a high price (since now he is out of them).  You could just continue to do that with the same merchant over and over.  He would have unlimited money so you could always make as much as you needed.  After that the game wasn't near as much fun.  I played through it to get to the end but the illusion of being in an alternate world was spoiled.  Its amazing to me how many developers mess up the economics in their games.  It should not be that complicated - just make sure that there are always useful/fun items to buy that are expensive enough that they take a long time to save the money.  Its just like in real life.  Why do you think so many athletes and movie stars get into so much trouble?  If things are too easy you just don't appreciate them.There were not enough hot keys to assign all the gestures, dances, spells, etc.You should be able to have a separate row of hot keys for different situations.  You could then toggle through them or the game could automatically bring up the right ones depending on the situation.  e.g.  one set of hot keys for combat, one for flirting, etc.The combat was too hectic for my taste.  Too often you would be attacked by a horde of monsters and the combat degenerated into a mashing of keys.  The requirement that you collect the experience instead of getting it automatically on the kill was just a needless complexity.Overall I'd say the developers did a very good job.  There were a lot of neat ideas that were put into the game.  Its definitely worth a look if you like RPG's. The game is ugly.
When starting the game it seemed like it was made for little kids but I stuck with it and it turned into a fairly good RPG.The game was very stable - zero crashes.  Graphics were good.Comedy was nicely interjected although some of it was pretty juvenile.  (farting and belching on command, I'm kind of surprised there wasn't an option for relieving yourself)I loved all the mini-games.

I'm a big fan of the AoE series...but AOE3 with the new interface ruined the experience for me.  The angle of the interface combined with the clutter of multiple smaller windows just made the game too much of a hassle to play.  The special effects were great as were the storylines, the new generations, new types of characters, battles...but the interface made the game all but unplayable -- for me.  I have to say that the graphics are amazing.

I suggest not playing Mario Kart Double Dash and then going straight to this version, it seems lacking.Don't get me wrong, I love the Mario Kart series, it just seems this was a let down and a huge price to pay for it.With the MK:DD you could have 2 characters and throw items in front and behind you, by your own choice. Have huge multiplayer battles and hell of alot more. All this game has is a small number of characters, 30+ tracks and that's about it. I didn't think it was a good addition to the series, not only but it's difficult to control and fire weapons when your driving with your DS.All in all, if your a fan of the series, buy it. If not, wait for Double Dash 2. I know I am.

Sure I've heard of Mario but didn't know a thing about the game. That was until I played it on wii at a friends house and found out if was a blast.I had to search out and wait for a sale or used one and it paid off I found one. What fun it is. Not quite the same as wii of course but still very much fun and I am much better at staying on the track on this one but still not winning very many races.Practice makes perfect. I was also recommended this by another adult DS player who read my Listmania and responded I needed this and one more game to round out my adult collection. She was right. Now I just have to sell a game as I have a rule one comes in one goes out. Guess I had better hurry and solve Professor Layton and the curious villiage. Who knew that one would be so hard. Yikes I've logged 10 hours not all at once and seem to be getting no where. Oh well different story.Get Mario Kart it is tons of fun.

Talk about nostalgia.  Wow.  This is a flashback to when you actually had to leave the house and go to a thing known as an "arcade" with a fistfull of quarters to play video games.  God, I sound old and bitter.  LOL  I am SOOOOO over it.  This is a wonderful collection of all the games I loved playing when I was younger.  If you want a wonderful trip down memory lane, PICK THIS UP.  You don't even need quarters.  The people who grew up with SNES or newer my not totally appreciate these games, but us "old-timers" most definitely will.

The people who grew up with SNES or newer my not totally appreciate these games, but us "old-timers" most definitely will. The game is unpleasant.
Talk about nostalgia.  Wow.  This is a flashback to when you actually had to leave the house and go to a thing known as an "arcade" with a fistfull of quarters to play video games.

This game has been with me for about a month now, I played as Demoness, found the adventure quite interesting,and the skill progression very informative and effective. The game is quite addictive, never a dull moment,there is always some adversary to fight, loot to collect and compare with already equipped things, magicallyhidden (don't show even with Alt pressed unless mouse cursor on them) stashes.There are save slots (3 of them) where you can save (and load from) at various stages, when you think it prudent.I prefer this way rather than automatic "Save and Exit" type of saving (like in Sacred 2: Fallen Angel, or Fate),where there is essentially only ONE saved game: if you choose, for example, to upgrade one skill,and this turns out to be not the best idea, Sacred: Gold allows you to load one of your previous versions,granting you a "redo" of sort, no such luck with the "Save and Exit" saving type.The quest compass, pointing to main (story line) quests, as wel as to currently active side quest, is a nice feature, as the Sacred world is vast. A detailed account is kept of monsters vanquished.Overall, a very well-made role-playing game, I am very pleased with Sacred Gold edition.

I never played the first Katamari but this one I picked up out of impulse. I heard from everywhere that it was great but I was afraid that my friends would find out that I bought it because the cover is all colorful and it looks like a kids game while you're playing. Everything is all colorful and whimsical and theres rainbows and crap. Plus, theres skipping. You can skip around the landscape in the level selection menu and if you pass another person like you, they follow you, skipping and singing. It's very very very gay. And yet, it's one of the best games I've played. It's original and just tons and tons of fun. Plus, it's incredibly addictive. I had to go somewhere the day after I got it and the whole time, all I could think about was this game. I couldn't wait to get home and play it. The game is awesome but they could have at least made the cover less colorful. Maybe have a gun and a couple hobos in a back alley on the cover  just so I wouldn't be embarassed when people are looking at my game collection and see a title with a heart on it and colorful creatures around a colorful  house... ugh.

I played the living daylights out of this game when it first came out, then tore myself away to play other offerings in the genre.  Having played every similar title, before and since.  Lately, I found myself missing the addicting, and fun game-play, so I reinstalled.  It's love all over again.I can't put my finger on what this game has that so many others don't.  I think it's just a fine combination of a lot of things, masterfully rolled into one.  I'm not going to bore the reader with highpoints that have already been covered here, let me just say, that this game grabs you, and you won't want it to let you go.  Bottom line is, is just fun.  Period.  The kind of fun that makes the hours slip away.It's worth mentioning too, that I've never seen 3D and 2D graphics combined in such a beautiful way.  The game is gorgeous.  There are day and night cycles, there's fog, realistic shadows, etc.  If there is to be a Sacred 2, I sincerely hope they don't go totally 3D.Anyway, grab Sacred Gold.  Don't even think about it.  Download the 2.28 patch as well, which will allow you to play without using the disc.  The only downside is finding the time to play this huge game as much as you would like.  You won't find this kind of value for money anywhere else.  Nor will you miss the questionable quality of recent 'rushed' products with more style than substance.

I played the living daylights out of this game when it first came out, then tore myself away to play other offerings in the genre.  Having played every similar title, before and since.  Lately, I found myself missing the addicting, and fun game-play, so I reinstalled.  It's love all over again.I can't put my finger on what this game has that so many others don't.  I think it's just a fine combination of a lot of things, masterfully rolled into one.  I'm not going to bore the reader with highpoints that have already been covered here, let me just say, that this game grabs you, and you won't want it to let you go.  Bottom line is, is just fun.  Period.  The kind of fun that makes the hours slip away.It's worth mentioning too, that I've never seen 3D and 2D graphics combined in such a beautiful way.  The game is gorgeous.  There are day and night cycles, there's fog, realistic shadows, etc.  If there is to be a Sacred 2, I sincerely hope they don't go totally 3D.Anyway, grab Sacred Gold.  Don't even think about it.

I have to say that Sacred is one of the best action/RPG games out there.  This is my favorite genre of games to play and I own many, many hack 'n slashers like this one,(including Diablo of course) and with the exception of Divine Divinity, this is my favorite one to play.I'm sure many people will think it is sacrilige to say this game is better than Diablo II but it really comes close. Especially now that this game is super cheap ('cause it's kind of old) it is a great value.  Go out and buy this game, you won't regret it.  (I would like to finish by saying Divine Divinity is THE best action/RPG, and it's only 10 bucks!!)

I was disapointed.So where the gamers.  The developer screwed up again, its not the first time, he went on a public forum to apologize.we where promised a much more open ended game, this game, its really not open ended at all.  You follow a set of quests, you can do them on your own time, but they are needed to further the story.  The story was lacking, uninvolving and uninteresting if you ask me.  I played the whole game and I'm still not quite sure what its about besides being a hero, save the world and all that Jazz, (or destroy it.) you can make a few choices that affect the game play, but not in any big way.  Basically, these choices change what people shout at you as you walk through town.you can ofcourse chose to be good or evil as is trendy in games now.  The armour and weapon selection I found unimpressive.  I am a huge Final Fantasy fan, they are big shoes to fill in that department I suppose, but honsetly you get most of your weapons from a shop, you can augment them with fire or lightening etc but eh... so what?The game was over before I knew it, it was only 20 hours or so long for me.  the final boss came around before I knew it.  It was fun while it lasted, entertaining enough and there was a bit of openededness as far as effecting what your character page said and what people said about you, also what bards sang about you... so that aspect was mildly enjoyable.  I wouldn't say its a BAD game, but its not a great one.  Slightly above average, its pretty, the spells are fun to look at, there is some adult content, so I dont recomend for children.  There is a brothel in the game for example, and you can have sex with your wife, (or husband if your character swings that way) it doesn't show anything but there are noises, disturbing noises...Its alright.  I say if you have the cash to spare and your that curious, go for it, otherwise save your money and get something a little more original.  ^^

The developer screwed up again, its not the first time, he went on a public forum to apologize.we where promised a much more open ended game, this game, its really not open ended at all.  You follow a set of quests, you can do them on your own time, but they are needed to further the story.  The story was lacking, uninvolving and uninteresting if you ask me.  I played the whole game and I'm still not quite sure what its about besides being a hero, save the world and all that Jazz, (or destroy it.) you can make a few choices that affect the game play, but not in any big way.  Basically, these choices change what people shout at you as you walk through town.you can ofcourse chose to be good or evil as is trendy in games now.  The armour and weapon selection I found unimpressive.  I am a huge Final Fantasy fan, they are big shoes to fill in that department I suppose, but honsetly you get most of your weapons from a shop, you can augment them with fire or lightening etc but eh... so what?The game was over before I knew it, it was only 20 hours or so long for me.  the final boss came around before I knew it.  It was fun while it lasted, entertaining enough and there was a bit of openededness as far as effecting what your character page said and what people said about you, also what bards sang about you... so that aspect was mildly enjoyable.  I wouldn't say its a BAD game, but its not a great one.  Slightly above average, its pretty, the spells are fun to look at, there is some adult content, so I dont recomend for children.  There is a brothel in the game for example, and you can have sex with your wife, (or husband if your character swings that way) it doesn't show anything but there are noises, disturbing noises...Its alright.

Like all the other games I've played so far in the Nancy Drew series, Last Train to Moon Canyon is full of intrigue, suspicion, and fun puzzles for all ages. I was able to finish the game in one sitting in around five or so hours, so I feel that it was of a slightly below average game time than some of the other, longer Nancy Drew games. Still, the storyline was very interesting, and I enjoyed talking to all of the suspects. Most of the puzzles in the beginning are pretty easy, but a few of them required a visit to a hint site to help get me through them. I've found this to be the case for most all ND games. My only real quibble with the game is the fact that there are what felt to me like fewer places to explore in this game. For the most part, you are walking back and forth somewhat endlessly on the train, and that can get tiring at points. I would have enjoyed more places to poke around in, and more people to interrogate, although 3 - 4 people is the norm for an ND game.I definitely recommend this to anyone of any age who enjoys a solid mystery and a challenge.

Alright folks, I'm not going to waste your time describing all of the ins and outs of this title. Suffice it to say, if you've played any MarioKart title on any system out there before, and have enjoyed it, stop reading this right now and go out and get this game (and the DS to play it on if you don't already have it). This game takes everything great about the franchise and concentrates it into pure addictive fun in portable form.For those of you who were dissapointed with the Gamecube version (speaking for myself here), fear not- the controls are much more in line with the (previously my favorite) N64 version. That is, you have the defensive tools at your disposal- holding items behind your cart to cover your rear, the 3 rotating shells make their appropriate return, the slide gives you a little "jump" action, etc. Before I got the game, I was concerned that it would be hard to pull off powerslides with the D-pad as opposed to analog control, but it is quite easy to execute them (perhaps a little too easy, as you don't start to spin out if you hold in one direction for a while). As others have stated, the bottom screen adds a whole new level of strategy as you can time your drop behind items for maximum efficacy, and see when something is coming for you, where coins are located, etc. As far as playability is concerned, everything is spot on (the GBA game was decent, but this is like night and day).The N64 version stole much of my college education time, and this little tiny cart is likely to steal even more, post-grad. Just think- you don't even have to get out of bed to play a course or two. If only I had friends that had DS's...I guess I'll have to go make some online! Highly recommended.

I recently bought the Warhammer 40,000 collection on a steam sale.  I figured for $10 it was worth taking a chance on and I was right.  First off, this game series has been very popular and received very good reviews.  I would say with good cause too.  The story is interesting, Dawn of War follows the struggle of a war torn, and recently traumatized, commander trying to root out Chaos on a planet that is being threatened by a storm and Orcs.  There are actually a lot of different factions vying for power in this game, you have the good humans, the bad humans(Chaos), Orcs, and Vanu, all of whom will fight you, the good humans, as you try to create armies big enough to confront your tasks.  This is a pretty straight forward Real Time Strategy(RTS) game based off of the very popular Wahammer table top role-playing games.  The game works in a series of steps, as do most RTS games, where you start to collect resources, build a base, then build an army, then attack the enemy.  Now that is a very simplified explanation but it serves a a good overview for those unfamiliar with RTS games.  The game has many expansions and a sequel so if players decide to get involved in this franchise there is plenty of gameplay available, both on and off the PC.  Considering the dire outlook for THQ I would highly recommend getting this series now before they go under.  I would like to see more of this game and I would like to see THQ continue to exist.  The game may feel a bit dated but I think it holds its value quite well.  I do find the controls a bit clunky but I assume they will improve as most games do with the follow up expansions and sequels.  Look for this on Steam and you can get quite a good deal.  Why buy it in piecemeal for the same price as the whole bundle.  THQ was also doing a Humble Bundle recently which is a great way to get good games, donate to charity, and support indy gaming, developers, plus the Humble Bundle itself.  Look around, the world of gaming has never looked brighter.

I recently bought the Warhammer 40,000 collection on a steam sale.  I figured for $10 it was worth taking a chance on and I was right.  First off, this game series has been very popular and received very good reviews.  I would say with good cause too.  The story is interesting, Dawn of War follows the struggle of a war torn, and recently traumatized, commander trying to root out Chaos on a planet that is being threatened by a storm and Orcs.  There are actually a lot of different factions vying for power in this game, you have the good humans, the bad humans(Chaos), Orcs, and Vanu, all of whom will fight you, the good humans, as you try to create armies big enough to confront your tasks.  This is a pretty straight forward Real Time Strategy(RTS) game based off of the very popular Wahammer table top role-playing games.  The game works in a series of steps, as do most RTS games, where you start to collect resources, build a base, then build an army, then attack the enemy.  Now that is a very simplified explanation but it serves a a good overview for those unfamiliar with RTS games.  The game has many expansions and a sequel so if players decide to get involved in this franchise there is plenty of gameplay available, both on and off the PC.  Considering the dire outlook for THQ I would highly recommend getting this series now before they go under.  I would like to see more of this game and I would like to see THQ continue to exist.  The game may feel a bit dated but I think it holds its value quite well.  I do find the controls a bit clunky but I assume they will improve as most games do with the follow up expansions and sequels.  Look for this on Steam and you can get quite a good deal.  Why buy it in piecemeal for the same price as the whole bundle.  THQ was also doing a Humble Bundle recently which is a great way to get good games, donate to charity, and support indy gaming, developers, plus the Humble Bundle itself.  Look around, the world of gaming has never looked brighter. The game is terrible.

SWB2 allows you to fight as or alongside all your favorite/hated characters from both the 1st and 2nd Star Wars trilogies.  In addition, you can fight on Mustafar, Yavin IV, the Death Star, Hoth, and other great locales from these movies.  Upgraded in this version of SWB are &#34;monster kill&#34; missions where you can beat back (or be a part of) attacking hordes of Wampa's on Hoth or the like.  Fighting is either 1st or 3rd person and your battles can be extended to getting friends together on a local LAN or joining random groups on-line.Although there are changes in SWB2 that I thought made the game worse than the original (no more heat-seeker rocket grenades), the upgrades far outweigh them as the game play, graphics, interface, and overall enjoyment are all upgraded.  My son & I have been playing this game for years and we still enjoy getting on our LAN and slugging it out against eachother and/or the computer AI's.

I'm writing this review to help others. I purchased a Nancy Drew game, mistakenly assuming Windows Vista would be able to play XP compatible games.  After some research I found there are 13 Nancy Drew games that are considered incompatible with Vista. The manufacturer suggested a "work around", which fortunately worked on my particular game, Danger on Deception Island but it may not work for other games.  It's definitely worth a try.This is a statement on HER's website ( [...] ) regarding Windows Vista:"Unfortunately our first 13 games are not Vista Compatible, we are planning on re-releasing some of the more popular games with Vista compatibility but we don't have any set release dates as of yet. Starting with #14 - Danger By Design, all titles moving forward will be Vista compatible.There is an unsupported work around that may work, if during installation you set the default path as "My Documents" then the game could possibly run under Vista. Unfortunately, we can't give any more support or help on older games running under the Vista Operating system."The games that are NOT compatible with VISTA are:Games  Danger By DesignGames  Last Train to Blue Moon CanyonGames  Secret of the Old ClockGames  Curse of Blackmoor ManorGames  The Secret of Shadow RanchGames  Danger on Deception IslandGames  The Haunted CarouselGames  Ghost Dogs of Moon LakeGames  Secret of the Scarlet HandGames  The Final SceneGames  Treasure in the Royal TowerGames  Message in a Haunted MansionGames  Stay Tuned for DangerGames  Secrets Can Kill

I'm writing this review to help others. I purchased a Nancy Drew game, mistakenly assuming Windows Vista would be able to play XP compatible games.  After some research I found there are 13 Nancy Drew games that are considered incompatible with Vista. The manufacturer suggested a "work around", which fortunately worked on my particular game, Danger on Deception Island but it may not work for other games.

As in the previous game, the King of All Cosmos has destroyed the stars in the sky, and it is up to the Prince to go to Earth and roll up objects into a "katamari" -- a kind of sticky ball that grows as you attach things to it -- so that new stars can be built.Unlike its predecessor, We Love Katamari has relatively few "standard" stages. Instead, most of the stages give you some kind of specific challenge -- rolling with a burning katamari without letting its fire go out, rolling entirely underwater, getting as large as you can with a finite number of objects, and so forth.As a result it is rather harder.Nevertheless, if you've played and enjoyed the first game and want more challenges, this is the way to go. Fun new stages (and way more of them), a much larger World stage, and lots of weird and freaky challenges to try.

It was fun.  My roommate recommended it and it was inexpensive, so I gave it a try.  It was pretty good.  Not incredibly memorable, but captivating enough at the time.  A good and cheap way to pass some hours. Gameplay was pretty fun, graphics are somewhat dated, but fine.  There's a nice balance of humor in the game, and the story was so-so.  If you're looking looking for something to keep you busy until witcher 3 comes out this might be good.  For a richer old-school RPG experience (though graphically inferior) I would play avernum: escape from the pit (or blades of exile).  For a more linear RPG like this I would probably play something from Bioware (though not jade empire).  For some reason this reminded me more of Jade Empire or the 20 minutes I played ninja gaiden that one time than many other RPGs.  I didn't love it, but it was kinda fun.

I only got this game cause my little cousin had it and he begged me to try it. The graphics were amazing and it was easy and fun to boot. I've always had a hard time with racing games being too short, this one was not there are 32+ tracks and plenty to do. Multiplayer is fun...blow into the mic if you don't want to lose in one hit...I had to figure that out. Also I've played every mario kart game to date and this is the best overall. Save for Mario 64 DS, this is one game to try on DS.

The only other Mariokart I've played is the one for the 64, but I got hooked on that fast--and this one's even better! You start with only four available  races in three different difficulty levels, but each time you win you unlock new racetracks, characters, and karts, which keeps you hooked, wanting to see what comes next.  If you love mario OR racing, you'll love this game. The only downside is its replay value--once you've unlocked all the characters and carts, it gets a little boring since you have nothing to do but try to beat your top scores. But even then it's still fun to pick up here and there when you have ten minutes to kill.It's great fun to play against other people who have the game too. I've only tried this feature a couple times but it's great!

If you love mario OR racing, you'll love this game. The only downside is its replay value--once you've unlocked all the characters and carts, it gets a little boring since you have nothing to do but try to beat your top scores. But even then it's still fun to pick up here and there when you have ten minutes to kill.It's great fun to play against other people who have the game too. I've only tried this feature a couple times but it's great. The game is dreadful.

The campaigns are okay (3 1/2 stars), but Skirmish is a joke.  Easy mode is way too easy and Standard is almost impossible. There is not enough balance to the different races. I challenge anyone to try and beat the Skirmish mode with the Imperial Guard and the AI as the Orks at Standard difficulty.  You will NEVER win.  The new units are great if you can ever get to them.  It takes for freakin ever to get your vehicles and by that time the AI has double what you have.  You will spend the entire game on the defensive building endless amounts of ineffective turrets while facing waves and waves of his scouts that are just a tough as your expensive regulars.  The IG is supposed to have numbers as one of it's "strengths", but you still start out with only 4 and have to spend a fortune to build them up in strength.  It's the same with the Chaos Marines, and Eldar.  The Space Marines is the only race you can pick in Skirmish mode and have a reasonable chance of victory.  Disappointing.

Sacred Gold is an OK game, with vast areas to explore and unique monsters to hack and slash. Gameplay gets somewhat repetative, and many of the secondary quests are lame, like searching for cookies for some old lady. The graphics are good, especially for an older PC like mine.My main complaint is with armor and weapon selection. Many games will let you try out equipment before you buy, to make sure that you're upgrading your character and not downgrading them. Some games even allow you to mouse-over equipment or show you a comparison to see what effects the new item will have on your characters attributes. There is no such animal in this game. You do the math here, and it's not so easy. If you buy a new expensive sword for instance, believing that it will enhance your character, and you're wrong.... you're out a lot of money. The sale price back to the merchant is now a fraction of what you just paid for it. This really lowers the fun value for me. That's why only 4 stars for this game. I'm used to Dungeon Siege 2 I guess...Also, the NPC and quest text seems to have been written by a group of 5 year olds, with some bad "speling" and "gramer" every once in awhile. Example; "I learnt how to use a sord..." It's kind of funny when you read it, and I guess humor is always good :)However, all that being said, the game is very fun to play and for the most part, I've really enjoyed playing it. I hop onto the back of a horse and ride to unknown lands killing off bad guys along the way. The Gold Edition is priced right, and you'll find the game to be a great way to kill some time. Works great with Windows Vista Home Premium. Try it out for yourself!

I'm used to Dungeon Siege 2 I guess...Also, the NPC and quest text seems to have been written by a group of 5 year olds, with some bad "speling" and "gramer" every once in awhile. Example; "I learnt how to use a sord..." It's kind of funny when you read it, and I guess humor is always good :)However, all that being said, the game is very fun to play and for the most part, I've really enjoyed playing it. I hop onto the back of a horse and ride to unknown lands killing off bad guys along the way. The Gold Edition is priced right, and you'll find the game to be a great way to kill some time. Works great with Windows Vista Home Premium. Try it out for yourself. The game is difficult.
Sacred Gold is an OK game, with vast areas to explore and unique monsters to hack and slash. Gameplay gets somewhat repetative, and many of the secondary quests are lame, like searching for cookies for some old lady. The graphics are good, especially for an older PC like mine.My main complaint is with armor and weapon selection. Many games will let you try out equipment before you buy, to make sure that you're upgrading your character and not downgrading them. Some games even allow you to mouse-over equipment or show you a comparison to see what effects the new item will have on your characters attributes. There is no such animal in this game.

This works well charging my GBA SP, but it feels like it was cheaply made.I recommend it if you don't have the money to buy the OEM charger and need something in a pinch!

All of the Mario Kart games are fun to play but Mario Kart DS is my favorite because it has some of the coolest levels in the series. In addition to the old school style levels there are new ones to the Mario Kart series like Luigi's Mansion and Tick Tock Clock.The graphics are really smooth and better than most of the other games in the series and the game is a lot of fun. The only thing that would make it even better than it is would be if you could play the game on a tv.

i am sick of people bashing other systems specially when the things you say about have never happend to you. if i had enough id buy a psp AND a ds i would get a ds for the gameplay and the sequels and return of former games that i love(animal crossing, mario,etc)and the backwards compatability with advance games.psp for good quality graphix and games(twisted metal,socom,etc).if you are going to bash a system or company make sure what you say is something you have experienced not just stuff you heard.i dont like xbox thats the only system i dont like but i didnt bash it once.why cant the consoles share there research then gaming would improve faster i mean look you have got a company who has been there for a while and has tons of research stored(nintendo)a company run by one of the riches men in the world and tons of grafical research im sure(x-box(keep in mind i dont like them but im complimenting them))and a company who knows there way around the media with all there mp3 players and cameras etc...(sony)put that together and what do you get?crap?or a system?

Despite the buggy AIs in the game, it's still a fantastic game that has many facets of entertainment and hidden things. My favorite is the ship battles, where you can go onto the other team's ship and blow up stuff from the inside.I tried to play online, but people using mods and cheats take all the fun away.

Despite the buggy AIs in the game, it's still a fantastic game that has many facets of entertainment and hidden things.

First of all, I just want to point out the fact that you will not find another MMORPG like this.  It's simply the most involving, the most up to date, and the most eventful game you will EVER play!  I am going to go through each aspect of the game, simply so you can see how well the game is overall.First of all, let's talk about the sound / video.  The game's graphics are very good.  They are not top notch, of course, but they are EXCELLENT when compared with the sound and the gameplay.  The sound is excellent, I love the music from the game.  I loved it SO MUCH that I had to buy the soundtrack.  This was a five star rating for me, overall.  The graphics are about four stars.The gameplay is wonderful.  I LOVE the game itself because fighting is fun, and it takes time.  You have to work with your team and stay on task to win, and that is what is so wonderful about it all!  If you wish to stay alive, however, you need to watch where you are.  There is a lot of wandering monsters that would LOVE to eat you alive, if you know what I mean...  This adds to the thrill of the game.  Five stars.The overall game is wonderful.  You will get a lot from this game.  It's tons of fun, and it has a lot to do inside the game.  You WILL be fighting a lot, but you will also be questing a lot.  You just have to have patience, and the game will grow and become better.

You know, I was talking with my former science teacher (Who grew up in the NES era) about Super Castlevania 4 today, and how much fun the game was. Apparently, he told me he doesn't remember playing that one. He said he gave up on the series due to this sore thumb. According to him, he paid a big $40 for the game (I guess that's the standard price of NES games then), and the result was a boring/confusing sequel that didn't live up to the original.Of course, I wouldn't be writing this review if I hadn't played it myself, but I still gotta agree with him. Castlevania 2 isn't about linear action platforming fun. Instead, it's about whipping monsters for hearts to purchase items and conquering lying civilians to progress forward. On top of that, the level design is bland, bland, bland. There isn't too much of a variety of anything (mainly enemies) when going anywhere.Since there are certain areas to go, you may as well listen to what the non-playable characters have to say, right? No. They actually happen to lie at times. Unbelievable, right? How can you play a game that you definitely need tips on what to do if you get the wrong tips? As much as I would want to go get Nintendo Power issue #2 for help, it costs a hefty $40+ on Amazon (go figure..). Maybe there's a scan floating around on the Internet, but it is still inexcusable for Konami to release Castlevania 2 as is. And don't get me started on when the in-game day turns night...That's not to say there was no fun factor or appeal at all. The graphics are still fantastic, and the music is awesome. The classic Castlevania whipping action, although bombarded by everything above, is still there, and still fun to do. Had there been even more work done on this game, this would've been an absolute masterpiece.

No. They actually happen to lie at times. Unbelievable, right? How can you play a game that you definitely need tips on what to do if you get the wrong tips? As much as I would want to go get Nintendo Power issue #2 for help, it costs a hefty $40+ on Amazon (go figure..). Maybe there's a scan floating around on the Internet, but it is still inexcusable for Konami to release Castlevania 2 as is. And don't get me started on when the in-game day turns night...That's not to say there was no fun factor or appeal at all. The graphics are still fantastic, and the music is awesome. The classic Castlevania whipping action, although bombarded by everything above, is still there, and still fun to do. Had there been even more work done on this game, this would've been an absolute masterpiece. The game is awful.
You know, I was talking with my former science teacher (Who grew up in the NES era) about Super Castlevania 4 today, and how much fun the game was. Apparently, he told me he doesn't remember playing that one. He said he gave up on the series due to this sore thumb. According to him, he paid a big $40 for the game (I guess that's the standard price of NES games then), and the result was a boring/confusing sequel that didn't live up to the original.Of course, I wouldn't be writing this review if I hadn't played it myself, but I still gotta agree with him. Castlevania 2 isn't about linear action platforming fun. Instead, it's about whipping monsters for hearts to purchase items and conquering lying civilians to progress forward.

I know that I'm a bit older, and somewhat new to gaming, but this was not at all what I thought it would be.  I got it loaded just fine, ran through the tutorial, and began.  How dull.  I couldn't see enough of the field to make things happen, and I grew very tired of the lame responses when I gave an order.  I did learn what I didn't like, and won't be ordering any other games like this in the future.  Experience is a great teacher.

This ac adapter works perfect for my SNES. The only issue I have is that it has, as you see in the picture of it, 2 AC cables that are separate. I ended up using electrical tape to keep them together so that I don't have excess wire mess.

I really do like this game but the game has problems in it like freezing up and sometimes sam will not do anything in the catacombs level in the pit when you killed all the deadites and ash disapears in the shipyard level when one of those green monster deadites jump on you ash is not even their and the diffulculty in this game is normal in my opinion this game is not alot easier than evil dead A Fistful Of BoomStick This game is alot harder because I hate 3 bosses in this game the frog boss the boss in level 4 is a cheap bitch and reinhard is a cheap ass bastard it took me 20 tries to beat reinhard because of his cheapness in this game which was pissing me off because he would kill everytime until I finally beat the game and the ending sucks in this game ash and sam killed both reinhard and sally and they go into the portal and disapear im like what happend next which to me the ending in Evil Dead A Fistful Of Boomstick is alot better of a ending.
